Title: A distinct gene module uncouples dysfunction from activation in tumor-infiltrating T cells (batch 2) 
Summary: Reversing the dysfunctional T cell state that arises in cancer and chronic viral infections is the focus of therapeutic interventions; however, current therapies are effective in only some patients and some tumor types. To gain a deeper molecular understanding of the dysfunctional T cell state, we analyzed population and single-cell RNA profiles of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and used genetic perturbations to identify a distinct gene module for T cell dysfunction that can be uncoupled from T cell activation. This distinct dysfunction module is downstream of intracellular metallothioneins that regulate zinc metabolism and can be identified at single-cell resolution. We further identify Gata-3, a zinc-finger transcription factor in the dysfunctional module, as a regulator of dysfunction, and use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to show that it drives a dysfunctional phenotype in CD8+ TILs. Our results open novel avenues for targeting dysfunctional T cell states, while leaving activation programs intact.

Title: Laminin-guided highly efficient endothelial commitment from human pluripotent stem cells [Single Cell RNA-Seq] 
Summary: Obtaining highly purified differentiated cells via directed differentiation from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) is an essential step for the clinical application of hPSCs. Among the various conditions that should be optimized, the precise role and contribution of the extracellular matrix (ECM) during differentiation are relatively unclear. Here, using a short fragment of laminin 411 (LM411-E8), an ECM predominantly expressed in the vascular endothelial basement membrane, we demonstrated that the directed switching of defined ECMs robustly yields highly purified (>95%) endothelial progenitor cells (PSC-EPCs) from hPSCs in integrin-laminin axis and rho signaling pathway-dependent manner.

Title: Genome-wide detection of DNase I hypersensitive sites in single cells and FFPE tissue samples 
Summary: DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) provide important information on the presence of transcriptional regulatory elements and the state of chromatin in mammalian cells1, 2, 3. Conventional DNase sequencing (DNase-seq) for genome-wide DHSs profiling is limited by the requirement of millions of cells4, 5. Here we report an ultrasensitive strategy, called single-cell DNase sequencing (scDNase-seq) for detection of genome-wide DHSs in single cells. We show that DHS patterns at the single-cell level are highly reproducible among individual cells. Among different single cells, highly expressed gene promoters and enhancers associated with multiple active histone modifications display constitutive DHS whereas chromatin regions with fewer histone modifications exhibit high variation of DHS. Furthermore, the single-cell DHSs predict enhancers that regulate cell-specific gene expression programs and the cell-to-cell variations of DHS are predictive of gene expression. Finally, we apply scDNase-seq to pools of tumour cells and pools of normal cells, dissected from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue slides from patients with thyroid cancer, and detect thousands of tumour-specific DHSs. Many of these DHSs are associated with promoters and enhancers critically involved in cancer development. Analysis of the DHS sequences uncovers one mutation (chr18: 52417839G>C) in the tumour cells of a patient with follicular thyroid carcinoma, which affects the binding of the tumour suppressor protein p53 and correlates with decreased expression of its target gene TXNL1. In conclusion, scDNase-seq can reliably detect DHSs in single cells, greatly extending the range of applications of DHS analysis both for basic and for translational research, and may provide critical information for personalized medicine.

Title: Single-cell transcriptional profiling of Th17 cells, differentiated in vitro for 48h [IL1B_IL6_IL23-48h-IL-17A/GFP+] 
Summary: Extensive cellular heterogeneity exists within specific immune-cell subtypes classified as a single lineage, but its molecular underpinnings are rarely characterized at a genomic scale. Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneity and pathogenicity of Th17 cells isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and lymph nodes (LN) at the peak of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or polarized in vitro under either pathogenic or non-pathogenic differentiation conditions. Computational analysis reveals a spectrum of cellular states in vivo, including a self-renewal state, Th1-like effector/memory states and a dysfunctional/senescent state. Relating these states to in vitro differentiated Th17 cells, unveils genes governing pathogenicity and disease susceptibility. Using knockout mice, we validate four novel genes: Gpr65, Plzp, Toso and Cd5l (in a companion paper). Cellular heterogeneity thus informs Th17 function in autoimmunity, and can identify targets for selective suppression of pathogenic Th17 cells while sparing non-pathogenic tissue-protective ones.

Title: Transcriptomes of individual substantia nigra pars reticulata neurons 
Summary: Certain neuron types fire spontaneously at high rates, an ability that is crucial for their function in brain circuits. The spontaneously active GABAergic neurons of the substantia nigra pars reticulata (SNr), a major output of the basal ganglia, provide tonic inhibition of downstream brain areas. A depolarizing "leak" current supports this firing pattern, but its molecular basis remains poorly understood. To understand how SNr neurons maintain tonic activity, we used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptome of individual SNr neurons. We discovered that SNr neurons express the sodium leak current, NaLCN and that SNr neurons lacking NaLCN have impaired spontaneous firing.

Title: Characterization of the single-cell (ES and MEF) transcriptional landscape by highly multiplex RNA-Seq 
Summary: Our understanding of the development and maintenance of tissues has been greatly aided by large-scale gene expression analysis. However, tissues are invariably complex, and expression analysis of a tissue confounds the true expression patterns of its constitutent cell types. Here we describe a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Single-cell RNA-Seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data was projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselvesâall without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy was demonstrated by analyzing the complete transcriptomes of 92 single cells of two distinct types. We believe this strategy will enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally occurring cell types during development, adult physiology and disease.

Title: Condensin-Driven Remodeling of X-Chromosome Topology during Dosage Compensation [RNA-Seq] 
Summary: The three-dimensional (3D) organization of a genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression, yet little is known about the machinery and mechanisms that determine higher-order chromosome structure or how structure influences gene expression. Here we exploit the X-chromosome-wide process of dosage compensation to dissect these mechanisms. The dosage compensation complex (DCC) of C. elegans, a condensin complex, binds to both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites via sequence-specific recruitment sites (rex sites) to reduce chromosome-wide gene expression by half. Using genome-wide chromosome conformation capture and single-cell FISH to compare chromosome structure in wild-type and DCC-defective embryos (DC mutants), we show that the DCC remodels X chromosomes of hermaphrodites into a spatial conformation distinct from autosomes. The dosage-compensated X chromosomes are composed of Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) that have sharper boundaries and more regular spacing than TADs on autosomes. Most TAD boundaries on X coincide with the highest-affinity rex sites, and these boundaries are lost or diminished in DC mutants, thereby restoring the topology of X to a native conformation resembling that of autosomes. Although most rex sites engage in multiple strong DCC-dependent long-range interactions, the strongest interactions occur between rex sites at the DCC-dependent TAD boundaries. We propose the DCC actively shapes the topology of the entire X chromosome by forming new TAD boundaries and reinforcing pre-existing weak TAD boundaries through interactions between its highest affinity sites. Such changes in higher-order X-chromosome structure then influence gene expression over long distances.

Title: A multiplexed single-cell CRISPR screening platform enables systematic dissection of the unfolded protein response 
Summary: Functional genomics efforts face tradeoffs between number of perturbations examined and complexity of phenotypes measured. We bridge this gap with Perturb-seq, which combines droplet-based single-cell RNA-seq with a strategy for barcoding CRISPR-mediated perturbations, allowing many perturbations to be profiled in pooled format. We applied Perturb-seq to dissect the mammalian unfolded protein response (UPR) using single and combinatorial CRISPR perturbations. A genome-scale CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen identified genes whose depletion perturbs ER homeostasis. Subjecting ~100 hits to Perturb-seq enabled high-precision functional clustering of genes. Single-cell analyses revealed epistasis among the three UPR branches, bifurcated UPR branch activation between cells subject to the same perturbation, and differential activation of the branches across hits, including a feedback loop between the translocon and the IRE1α branch. These studies provide insight into how the three sensors of ER homeostasis monitor distinct types of stress and highlight the ability of Perturb-seq to dissect complex cellular responses.

Title: Transcriptomes of lineage-specific Drosophila neuroblasts profiled via genetic targeting and robotic sorting 
Summary: A brain consists of numerous distinct neurons arising from a limited number of progenitors, called neuroblasts in Drosophila. Each neuroblast makes a specific neuronal lineage. To unravel the transcriptional networks that underlie the development of distinct neuroblast lineages, we marked and isolated lineage-specific neuroblasts for RNA sequencing. We labeled particular neuroblasts throughout neurogenesis by activating a conditional neuroblast driver in specific lineages using various intersection strategies. The targeted neuroblasts were efficiently recovered using a custom-built device for robotic single cell picking. Transcriptome analysis on the mushroom body, antennal lobe, and type II neuroblasts besides non-selective neuroblasts, neurons, and glia revealed a rich repertoire of transcription factors expressed among neuroblasts in diverse patterns. In addition to those likely pan-neuroblast transcription factors, there exist many transcription factors selectively enriched or repressed in certain neuroblasts. The unique combinations of transcription factors present in different neuroblasts may govern the diverse lineage-specific neuron fates

Title: The transcriptional landscape of mouse blood stem/progenitor cell transitions at single cell resolution 
Summary: Current gene-expression databases for the haematopoietic system provide information on gene expression profiles present in bulk populations. Although informative, these studies lack the resolution that can be gained at a single-cell level. In particular, population-average data assumes homogeneity within the population and may as such obscure the ability to detect the heterogeneity of decision-making processes in individual cells. Here we report 1656 single cell transcriptomes analysed by single-cell RNA sequencing. Cells were FACS sorted on broad gates encompassing haematopoietic stem and progenitor populations (HSPCs), with index sorting data collected to permit retrospective identification of populations by surface marker expression. Our dataset thus represents the gene expression landscape of HSPCs at single-cell resolution, capturing the heterogeneity in and between cell populations. Pseudotime analysis visualized haematopoietic stem (HSC) to progenitor transitions, identified HSC as well as lineage-specific transcriptional programs, and also highlighted putative lineage branching points. To provide access to the wider scientific community, a user-friendly website was developed with intuitive search and display functionality.

Title: Transcriptomic Analysis of Petunia hybrida in Response to Salt Stress Using High Throughput RNA Sequencing 
Summary: Salinity and drought stress are the primary cause of crop losses worldwide. In sodic saline soils sodium chloride (NaCl) disrupts normal plant growth and development. The complex interactions of plant systems with abiotic stress have made RNA sequencing a more holistic and appealing approach to study transcriptome level responses in a single cell and/or tissue. In this work, we determined the Petunia transcriptome response to NaCl stress by sequencing leaf samples and assembling 196 million Illumina reads with Trinity software. Using our reference transcriptome we identified more than 7,000 genes that were differentially expressed within 24 h of acute NaCl stress. The proposed transcriptome can also be used as an excellent tool for biological and bioinformatics in the absence of an available Petunia genome and it is available at the SOL Genomics Network (SGN) http://solgenomics.net. Genes related to regulation of reactive oxygen species, transport, and signal transductions as well as novel and undescribed transcripts were among those differentially expressed in response to salt stress. The candidate genes identified in this study can be applied as markers for breeding or to genetically engineer plants to enhance salt tolerance. Gene Ontology analyses indicated that most of the NaCl damage happened at 24 h inducing genotoxicity, affecting transport and organelles due to the high concentration of Na+ ions. Finally, we report a modification to the library preparation protocol whereby cDNA samples were bar-coded with non-HPLC purified primers, without affecting the quality and quantity of the RNA-seq data. The methodological improvement presented here could substantially reduce the cost of sample preparation for future high-throughput RNA sequencing experiments

Title: Global Deterministic and Stochastic Allelic Specific Gene Expression in Single Blastomeres of Mouse Early Embryos 
Summary: Here we modified a single cell whole transcriptome amplification method to make it capable of amplifying cDNAs as long as 3kb efficiently and unbiasedly. We combined this modified single cell cDNA amplification method with Applied Biosystems next generation sequencing SOLiD™ System to set up a single cell whole transcriptome assay. The modified amplification strategy allows us to amplify full-length cDNAs for most of the expressed genes. We show that it is feasible to get digital gene expression profiles at single cell resolution. This allows us to ask fundamental biological questions that could not be addressed previously and to understand transcriptome complexity at the resolution of a single cell. Oocyte, Two-cell, Four-cell, and 8-cell stage embryos were recovered from MF1 females mated with MF1 male mice (Nagy et al. 2003).

Title: Innate-like functions of natural killer T cell subsets result from highly divergent gene programs [single_cell_RNA-seq] 
Summary: Natural killer T (NKT) cells have immune stimulatory or inhibitory effects on the immune response that are context-dependent. This may be attributed in part to the existence of functional NKT cell subsets; however, these functional subsets have only been characterized on the basis of differential expression of a few transcription factors and cell surface molecules. Here we have analyzed purified populations of thymic NKT cell subsets at both the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels, and by single-cell RNA sequencing. Our data indicate that despite their similar antigen specificity, the functional NKT cell subsets are highly divergent populations characterized by many gene expression and epigenetic differences. Therefore the thymus imprints innate-like NKT cells with novel combinations of properties, including differences in proliferative capacity, homing, and effector functions that were not previously anticipated.

Title: Population transcriptional profiling of Th17 cells, isolated from the lamina propria of the large intestine from 3-6 month old IL-17GFP KI mice 
Summary: Extensive cellular heterogeneity exists within specific immune-cell subtypes classified as a single lineage, but its molecular underpinnings are rarely characterized at a genomic scale. Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneity and pathogenicity of Th17 cells isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and lymph nodes (LN) at the peak of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or polarized in vitro under either pathogenic or non-pathogenic differentiation conditions. Computational analysis reveals a spectrum of cellular states in vivo, including a self-renewal state, Th1-like effector/memory states and a dysfunctional/senescent state. Relating these states to in vitro differentiated Th17 cells, unveils genes governing pathogenicity and disease susceptibility. Using knockout mice, we validate four novel genes: Gpr65, Plzp, Toso and Cd5l (in a companion paper). Cellular heterogeneity thus informs Th17 function in autoimmunity, and can identify targets for selective suppression of pathogenic Th17 cells while sparing non-pathogenic tissue-protective ones.

Title: Innate-like functions of natural killer T cell subsets result from highly divergent gene programs [bulk_RNA-seq] 
Summary: Natural killer T (NKT) cells have immune stimulatory or inhibitory effects on the immune response that are context-dependent. This may be attributed in part to the existence of functional NKT cell subsets; however, these functional subsets have only been characterized on the basis of differential expression of a few transcription factors and cell surface molecules. Here we have analyzed purified populations of thymic NKT cell subsets at both the transcriptomic and epigenomic levels, and by single-cell RNA sequencing. Our data indicate that despite their similar antigen specificity, the functional NKT cell subsets are highly divergent populations characterized by many gene expression and epigenetic differences. Therefore the thymus imprints innate-like NKT cells with novel combinations of properties, including differences in proliferative capacity, homing, and effector functions that were not previously anticipated.

Title: Pseudo-temporal ordering of individual cells reveals regulators of differentiation 
Summary: Single-cell expression profiling by RNA-Seq promises to exploit cell-to-cell variation in gene expression to reveal regulatory circuitry governing cell differentiation and other biological processes. Here, we describe Monocle, a novel unsupervised algorithm for ordering cells by progress through differentiation that dramatically increases temporal resolution of expression measurements. This reordering unmasks switch-like changes in expression of key regulatory factors, reveals sequentially organized waves of gene regulation, and exposes regulators of cell differentiation. A functional screen confirms that a number of these regulators dramatically alter the efficiency of myoblast differentiation, demonstrating that single-cell expression analysis with Monocle can uncover new regulators even in well-studied systems.

Title: Massively parallel single-cell RNA-Seq for dissecting cell type and cell state compositions 
Summary: In multi-cellular organisms, biological function emerges when cells of heterogeneous types and states are combined into complex tissues. Nevertheless unbiased dissection of tissues into coherent cell subpopulations is currently lacking. We introduce an automated, massively parallel single cell RNA sequencing method for intuitively analyzing in-vivo transcriptional states in thousands of single cells. Combined with unsupervised classification algorithms, it facilitates ab initio and marker-free characterization of classical hematopoietic cell types from splenic tissues. Importantly, modeling single cells transcriptional states in dendritic cells subpopulations, where a cell type hierarchy is difficult to define with marker-based approaches, uncovers complex combinatorial activity of multiple gene modules and capture cell-to-cell variability in steady state conditions and following pathogen activation. Massively parallel single cell RNA-seq thereby emerges as an effective tool for unbiased dissection of complex tissues.

Title: Transcriptome In Vivo Analysis (TIVA) of spatially defined single cells in intact live mouse and human brain tissue 
Summary: Transcriptome profiling is an indispensable tool in advancing the understanding of single cell biology, but depends upon methods capable of isolating mRNA at the spatial resolution of a single cell. Current capture methods lack sufficient spatial resolution to isolate mRNA from individual in vivo resident cells without damaging adjacent tissue. Because of this limitation, it has been difficult to assess the influence of the microenvironment on the transcriptome of individual neurons. Here, we engineered a Transcriptome In Vivo Analysis (TIVA)-tag, which upon photoactivation enables mRNA capture from single cells in live tissue. Using the TIVA-tag in combination with RNA-seq to analyze transcriptome variance among single dispersed cells and in vivo resident mouse and human neurons, we show that the tissue microenvironment shapes the transcriptomic landscape of individual cells. The TIVA methodology provides the first noninvasive approach for capturing mRNA from single cells in their natural microenvironment.

Title: Single Cell Sequencing Identifies Key Epigenetic Regulators in Nuclear Transfer Mediated Reprogramming [RNA-seq] 
Summary: Differentiated cell can be reprogrammed into totipotent embryo through somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). However, this process is highly inefficient and most cloned embryos arrest at certain developmental stages. Through single cell sequencing combined with embryo biopsy, here we generate a global map of DNA methylome and RNA transcriptome for SCNT embryos with distinct developmental fates. We subsequently demonstrate that the unfaithful reactivation of two histone demethylases, Kdm4b and Kdm5b, accounts for the arrest of cloned embryos at 2-cell and 4-cell stage, respectively. Ectopic expression of Kdm4b and Kdm5b in SCNT can remove H3K9me3 barrier, restore the transcription profile and facilitate the blastocyst developmental efficiency over 95%. Moreover, these cloned embryos can further support full-term development and the derivation of SCNT-embryonic stem cells with greater efficiency. Our study reveals that histone methylation reset is crucial for the development of SCNT embryos, which provides a clue to further improve therapeutic cloning.

Title: RNA Sequencing of Single Human Islet Cells Reveals Type 2 Diabetes Genes 
Summary: Pancreatic islet cells are critical for maintaining normal blood glucose levels and their malfunction underlies diabetes development and progression. We used single-cell RNA sequencing to determine the transcriptomes of 1,492 human pancreatic α-, β-, δ- and PP cells from non-diabetic and type 2 diabetes organ donors. We identified cell type specific genes and pathways as well as 245 genes with disturbed expression in type 2 diabetes. Importantly, 92% of the genes have not previously been associated with islet cell function or growth. Comparison of gene profiles in mouse and human α- and β-cells revealed species-specific expression. All data are available for online browsing and download and will hopefully serve as a resource for the islet research community.

Title: Hepatitis C virus functionally sequesters miR-122 [HCV vs Mock CLIP] 
Summary: Hepatitis C virus uniquely requires the liver specific microRNA-122 for replication, yet global effects on endogenous miRNA targets during infection are unexplored. Here, high-throughput sequencing and crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) experiments of human Argonaute (Ago) during HCV infection showed robust Ago binding on the HCV 5’UTR, at known and predicted miR-122 sites. On the human transcriptome, we observed reduced Ago binding and functional mRNA de-repression of miR-122 targets during virus infection. This miR-122 “sponge” effect could be relieved and redirected to miR-15 targets by swapping the miRNA tropism of the virus. Single-cell expression data from reporters containing miR-122 sites showed significant de-repression during HCV infection depending on expression level and number of sites. We describe a quantitative mathematical model of HCV induced miR-122 sequestration and propose that such miR-122 inhibition by HCV RNA may result in global de-repression of host miR-122 targets, providing an environment fertile for the long-term oncogenic potential of HCV.

Title: Differences and similarities between human and chimpanzee neural progenitors during cerebral cortex development 
Summary: Human neocortex expansion likely contributed to the remarkable cognitive abilities of humans. This expansion is thought to primarily reflect differences in proliferation versus differentiation of neural progenitors during cortical development. Here, we have searched for such differences by analysing cerebral organoids from human and chimpanzees using immunohistochemistry, live imaging, and single-cell transcriptomics. We find that the cytoarchitecture, cell type composition, and neurogenic gene expression programs of humans and chimpanzees are remarkably similar. Notably, however, live imaging of apical progenitor mitosis uncovered a lengthening of prometaphase-metaphase in humans compared to chimpanzees that is specific to proliferating progenitors and not observed in non-neural cells. Consistent with this, the small set of genes more highly expressed in human apical progenitors points to increased proliferative capacity, and the proportion of neurogenic basal progenitors is lower in humans. These subtle differences in cortical progenitors between humans and chimpanzees may have consequences for human neocortex evolution.

Title: Phenotypic heterogeneity affects Stenotrophomonas maltophilia K279a colony morphotypes and β-lactamase expression 
Summary: Stenotrophomonas maltophilia K279a diverges into subpopulations with distinct but reversible phenotypes of small and big colonies when challenged with ampicillin. This observation is consistent with the formation of long cell chains during exponential growth phase and the occurrence of mainly coccoid– or rod-shaped cells in liquid media. Further, scanning electron micrographs of SMK279a revealed that cells formed gigantic outer membrane vesicles in response to β-lactam treatment. RNA-seq analysis of small vs. big colonies unveiled that cells regulate at least seven genes differentially among colony morphotypes. Among those were the blaL1 and blaL2 genes the most strongly regulated ones with an eleven- and six-fold increased transcription, respectively. Further studies with promoter fusions of blaL1 and blaL2 genes implied that expression of both genes is also subject to high levels of phenotypic heterogeneous expression on a single cell level. Additional RNA-seq analysis of this homogenously versus heterogeneously blaL2 expressing cells identified comE homologue as differentially expressed, in which by the expression of extra copies of comE in S. maltophilia K279a reduced the level of those cells that were in a blaL2-ON model to 1% or lower. Together with genome-wide sequence analysis of cells from the different colony morphotypes, the data presented here suggests that phenotypic heterogeneity in S. maltophilia K279a is a result of non-genetic variations within isogenic populations and also polymorphisms in this strain do not influence β-lactamase resistance phenotype.

To determine the relevance of ECM protein expression to human disease, CTCs were isolated from the blood of metastatic PDAC patients and subjected to single cell RNA-sequencing. Analysis of 7 pancreatic CTCs from 3 patients revealed that the majority expressed keratins defining their epithelial origin. A total of 13 of 60 extracellular protein genes enriched in mouse CTCs (see GEO GSE51372) were expressed at high levels (>100 rpm) in at least one human pancreatic CTC. Human SPARC was the only gene found at high levels in all human pancreatic CTCs.

Title: Systematic reconstruction of molecular cascades regulating growth plate development using single-cell RNA-seq 
Summary: The growth plate, which comprises sequentially differentiated cell layers, is a critical structure for bone elongation and regeneration. Although several key regulators in growth plate development have been identified using primarily genetic perturbation, the systematic understanding is still limited. Here we used single cell RNA-seq to interrogate gene expression profiles of 217 single cells from growth plates, and developed the bioinfromatics pipeline Sinova to de-novo reconstruct physiological growth plate development in both temporal and spatial high-resolution. Our unsupervised model not only confirmed prior knowledge but also enabled systematic discovery of novel genes, potential signal pathways and surface markers CD9/CD200 to precisely depict the development. Sinova further identified effective transcriptional factor portfolio directing growth plate maturation, which was cross-validated experimentally using an in-vitro EGFP-Col10a screening system. Our case demonstrated systematic reconstructing of molecular cascades of a developmental process from single-cell profiling, and the workflow is readily transferable to other physiological scenarios.

Title: Single cell RNAseq of electrophysiologically characterized neurons of the hippocampus 
Summary: Recent advances in single-cell RNAseq technologies are enabling new cell type classifications. For neurons, electrophysiological properties traditionally guide cell type classification but correlating RNAseq data with electrophysiological parameters has been difficult. Here we demonstrate RNAseq of electrophysiologically and synaptically characterized individual, patched neurons in the hippocampal CA1-region and subiculum, and relate the resulting transcriptome data to their electrical and synaptic properties. In this analysis, we explored the hypothesis that precise combinatorial interactions between matching cell-adhesion and signaling molecules shape synapse specificity. In analyzing interneurons and pyramidal neurons that are synaptically connected, we identified two independent, developmentally regulated networks of interacting genes encoding cell-adhesion, exocytosis and signal-transduction molecules. In this manner, our data allow postulating a presumed cell-adhesion and signaling code, which may explain neuronal connectivity at the molecular level. Our approach enables correlating electrophysiological with molecular properties of neurons, and suggests new avenues towards understanding synaptic specificity.

Title: A Primate lncRNA Mediates Notch Signaling During Neuronal Development by Sequestering miRNA [single cell sequencing analysis] 
Summary: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are a diverse category of transcripts with poor conservation and have expanded greatly in primates, particularly in their brain. We identified a lncRNA, which has acquired 16 microRNA response elements (MREs) for miR-143-3p in the Catarrhini branch of primates. This lncRNA termed LncND (neuro-development) gets expressed in neural progenitor cells and then declines in mature neurons. Binding and release of miR-143-3p, by LncND, can control the expression of Notch. Its expression is highest in radial glia cells in the ventricular and outer subventricular zones of human fetal brain. Down-regulation of LncND in neuroblastoma cells reduced cell proliferation and induced neuronal differentiation, an effect phenocopied by miR-143-3p over-expression and supported by RNA-seq analysis. These findings support a role for LncND in miRNA-mediated regulation of Notch signaling in the expansion of the neural progenitor pool of primates and hence contributing to the rapid growth of the cerebral cortex.

Summary: We report here a new single-cell RNA-seq assay, Multiple Annealing and dC-Tailing based Quantitative single-cell RNA-seq (MATQ-seq), which provides the accuracy and sensitivity that enable the detection of transcriptional variations existing in single cells of the same type. We performed a systematic characterization of the technical noise using pool-and-split averaged single-cell samples and showed that the biological variations in single cells were observed with statistical significance.

Title: RNA-Seq of Single Prostate CTCs Implicates Non-Canonical Wnt Signaling in Antiandrogen Resistance 
Summary: Prostate cancer is initially responsive to androgen deprivation, but the effectiveness of androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors in recurrent disease is variable. Biopsy of bone metastases is challenging, hence sampling circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may reveal drug resistance mechanisms. We established single cell RNA-sequencing profiles of 77 intact CTCs isolated from 13 patients (mean 6 CTCs/patient) using microfluidic enrichment. Single CTCs from each individual display considerable heterogeneity, including expression of AR gene mutations and splicing variants. Retrospective analysis of CTCs from patients progressing on AR inhibitor, compared with untreated cases indicates activation of noncanonical Wnt signaling (P=0.0064). Ectopic expression of Wnt5a in prostate cancer cells attenuates the antiproliferative effect of AR inhibition, while its suppression in drug-resistant cells restores partial sensitivity, a correlation also evident in an established mouse model. Thus, single cell analysis of prostate CTCs reveals heterogeneity in signaling pathways that could contribute to treatment failure.

Title: Dissecting the direct reprogramming path of fibroblasts into neurons by single cell RNA-sequencing 
Summary: Direct lineage reprogramming represents a remarkable conversion of cellular and transcriptome states. However, the intermediates through which individual cells progress are largely undefined. Here we used single cell RNA-seq at multiple time points to dissect direct reprogramming from mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) to induced neuronal (iN) cells. By deconstructing heterogeneity at each time point and ordering cells by transcriptome similarity rather than time we reconstructed a continuous reprogramming path. We find that overexpression of a single factor (Ascl1) results in a well-defined initialization causing cells to exit the cell cycle and re-focus gene expression through distinct neural transcription factors. However, overexpression of Ascl1 alone leads to abundant alternative fates that are suppressed by the combination of additional factors (Myt1l, Pou3f2). We find transgene silencing and emergence of alternative fates are the major efficiency limits of direct reprogramming. These data provide a high-resolution approach for understanding transcriptome states during lineage differentiation.

Title: p53 is a critical regulator of airway epithelial progenitor cell homeostasis. 
Summary: How progenitor cells regulate quiescence and differentiation is poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that the tumor suppressor p53 regulates both proliferation and differentiation of club progenitor cells in the airway epithelium. We show that p53 loss decreases ciliated cell differentiation and increases the proliferative capacity of club progenitors, increasing epithelial cell density. p53 deficient progenitors generated a pseudostratified epithelium containing basal-like cells in vitro and contained an increased proportion of BASCs in vivo, suggesting that p53 suppresses multipotency during homeostasis. Conversely, an additional copy of p53 decreases proliferation and increases ciliated cell differentiation. Using single cell RNA-Seq, we expose heterogeneity within airway epithelial progenitor cells and found that cell cycle regulators, particularly p21, are altered following p53 loss. Together, these findings reveal an essential role for p53 in regulating progenitor cell behavior, which has broad implications in understanding both stem cell and cancer biology

Title: Distinct myeloid progenitor differentiation pathways uncovered through single cell RNA sequencing 
Summary: Haematopoietic stem cells can differentiate into all blood cell types. In this process, cells become progressively restricted to a single cell type. The order in which differentiating cells loose lineage potential, and the prospective isolation of cells with a defined potential remains a long-standing question. We performed gene expression analysis of haematopoietic cells from Gata1-EGFP reporter mice, leading to a model for hematopoiesis where the initial lineage decision consists of a seperation of erythroid/megakaryocyte/mast cell/eosinophil potential from lymphopoietic/monocyte/neutrophil potential

Title: Molecular signatures of heterogeneous stem cell populations are resolved by linking single cell functional assays to single cell gene expression 
Summary: The discovery of significant heterogeneity in the self-renewal durability of adult haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) has challenged our understanding of the molecules involved in population maintenance throughout life. Gene expression studies in bulk populations are difficult to interpret since multiple HSC subtypes are present and HSC purity is typically less than 50% of the input cell population. Numerous groups have therefore turned to studying gene expression profiles of single HSCs, but again these studies are limited by the purity of the input fraction and an inability to directly ascribe a molecular program to a durable self-renewing HSC. Here we combine single cell functional assays with flow cytometric index sorting and single cell gene expression assays to gain the first insight into the gene expression program of HSCs that possess durable self-renewal. This approach can be used in other stem cell systems and sets the stage for linking key molecules with defined cellular functions.

Title: Expression data from 7 Human Melanomas 
Summary: Melanocytes within benign human nevi are the paradigm for tumor suppressive senescent cells in a pre-malignant neoplasm. These cells typically contain mutations in either the BRAF or N-RAS oncogene and express markers of senescence, including p16. However, a nevus can contain 10s to 100s of thousands of clonal melanocytes and approximately 20-30% of melanoma are thought to arise in association with a pre-existing nevus. Neither observation is indicative of fail-safe senescence-associated proliferation arrest and tumor suppression. We set out to better understand the status of nevus melanocytes. Proliferation-promoting Wnt target genes, such as cyclin D1 and c-myc, were repressed in oncogene-induced senescent melanocytes in vitro, and repression of Wnt signaling in these cells induced a senescent-like state. In contrast, cyclin D1 and c-myc were expressed in many melanocytes of human benign nevi. Specifically, activated Wnt signalling in nevi correlated inversely with nevus maturation, an established dermatopathological correlate of clinical benignancy. Single cell analyses of lone epidermal melanocytes and nevus melanocytes showed that expression of proliferation-promoting Wnt targets correlates with prior proliferative expansion of p16-expressing nevus melanocytes. In a mouse model, activation of Wnt signaling delayed, but did not bypass, senescence of oncogene-expressing melanocytes, leading to massive accumulation of proliferation-arrested, p16-positive non-malignant melanocytes. We conclude that clonal hyperproliferation of oncogene-expressing melanocytes to form a nevus is facilitated by transient delay of senescence due to activated Wnt signaling. The observation that activation of Wnt signaling correlates inversely with nevus maturation, an indicator of clinical benignancy, supports the notion that persistent destabilization of senescence by Wnt signaling contributes to the malignant potential of nevi.

Title: Cell fate inclination within 2-cell and 4-cell mouse embryos revealed by single-cell RNA sequencing 
Summary: It remains an open question when and how the first cell fate decision is made in mammals. Using deep single-cell RNA-seq of matched sister blastomeres, we report highly reproducible interblastomere differences among ten 2-cell and five 4-cell mouse embryos. Inter-blastomere gene expression differences dominated between-embryo differences and noises, and were sufficient to cluster sister blastomeres into distinct groups. Dozens of protein-coding genes exhibited reproducible bimodal expression in sister blastomeres (0 vs. 1e3-1e6 of FPKM), which cannot be explained by random fluctuations. The protein expression of one of these bimodal genes, Gadd45a, exhibited clear inter-blastomeric contrasts. We traced some of the bimodal mRNA expressions to embryonic genome activation, and others to blastomere-specific RNA depletion. Inter-blastomere differences created co-expression gene networks that were much stronger and larger than those that can be possibly created by random noises. The highly correlated gene pairs at the 4-cell overlapped with those showing the same directions of differential expression between inner cell mass (ICM) and trophectoderm (TE). These data substantiate the hypothesis of inter-blastomere differences in 2- and 4-cell mouse embryos, and associate these differences with ICM/TE differences.

Title: Single-Cell Transcriptomics Reveals a Population of Dormant Neural Stem Cells that Become Activated upon Brain Injury 
Summary: Heterogeneous pools of adult neural stem cells (NSCs) contribute to brain maintenance and regeneration after injury. The balance of NSC activation and quiescence, as well as the induction of lineage-specific transcription factors, may contribute to diversity of neuronal and glial fates. To identify molecular hallmarks governing these characteristics, we performed single-cell sequencing of an unbiased pool of adult subventricular zone NSCs. This analysis identified a discrete, dormant NSC subpopulation that already expresses distinct combinations of lineage-specific transcription factors during homeostasis. Dormant NSCs enter a primed-quiescent state before activation, which is accompanied by downregulation of glycolytic metabolism, Notch, and BMP signaling and a concomitant upregulation of lineage-specific transcription factors and protein synthesis. In response to brain ischemia, interferon gamma signaling induces dormant NSC subpopulations to enter the primed-quiescent state. This study unveils general principles underlying NSC activation and lineage priming and opens potential avenues for regenerative medicine in the brain.

Title: Hepatitis C virus functionally sequesters miR-122 [m15 vs Mock CLIP] 
Summary: Hepatitis C virus uniquely requires the liver specific microRNA-122 for replication, yet global effects on endogenous miRNA targets during infection are unexplored. Here, high-throughput sequencing and crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) experiments of human Argonaute (Ago) during HCV infection showed robust Ago binding on the HCV 5’UTR, at known and predicted miR-122 sites. On the human transcriptome, we observed reduced Ago binding and functional mRNA de-repression of miR-122 targets during virus infection. This miR-122 “sponge” effect could be relieved and redirected to miR-15 targets by swapping the miRNA tropism of the virus. Single-cell expression data from reporters containing miR-122 sites showed significant de-repression during HCV infection depending on expression level and number of sites. We describe a quantitative mathematical model of HCV induced miR-122 sequestration and propose that such miR-122 inhibition by HCV RNA may result in global de-repression of host miR-122 targets, providing an environment fertile for the long-term oncogenic potential of HCV.

Title: Gene Expression between two cell layers in maize shoot apical meristem 
Summary: All above ground organs of higher plants are ultimately derived from shoot apical meristems (SAMs). The SAM exhibits distinctive structural organization, and monocot SAMs such as maize are comprised of two cell layers, a single cell layered tunica (L1) and a corpus (L2). Although recent research has revealed roles of these cell layers in the SAM, intra- and inter-cell-layer signaling networks involved in organ development remain largely unknown except for a few differentially expressed genes. Here, we used Illumnia technology to conduct RNA-seq of L1 and L2 cell layers in maize B73 maize shoot apical meristem.

Title: Condensin-Driven Remodeling of X-Chromosome Topology during Dosage Compensation [Hi-C] 
Summary: The three-dimensional (3D) organization of a genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression, yet little is known about the machinery and mechanisms that determine higher-order chromosome structure or how structure influences gene expression. Here we exploit the X-chromosome-wide process of dosage compensation to dissect these mechanisms. The dosage compensation complex (DCC) of C. elegans, a condensin complex, binds to both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites via sequence-specific recruitment sites (rex sites) to reduce chromosome-wide gene expression by half. Using genome-wide chromosome conformation capture and single-cell FISH to compare chromosome structure in wild-type and DCC-defective embryos (DC mutants), we show that the DCC remodels X chromosomes of hermaphrodites into a spatial conformation distinct from autosomes. The dosage-compensated X chromosomes are composed of Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) that have sharper boundaries and more regular spacing than TADs on autosomes. Most TAD boundaries on X coincide with the highest-affinity rex sites, and these boundaries are lost or diminished in DC mutants, thereby restoring the topology of X to a native conformation resembling that of autosomes. Although most rex sites engage in multiple strong DCC-dependent long-range interactions, the strongest interactions occur between rex sites at the DCC-dependent TAD boundaries. We propose the DCC actively shapes the topology of the entire X chromosome by forming new TAD boundaries and reinforcing pre-existing weak TAD boundaries through interactions between its highest affinity sites. Such changes in higher-order X-chromosome structure then influence gene expression over long distances.

Title: Transcriptional heterogeneity and lineage commitment in myeloid progenitors [single cell RNA-seq] 
Summary: Within the bone marrow, hematopoietic stem cells differentiate and give rise to diverse blood cell types and functions. Currently, hematopoietic progenitors are defined using surface markers combined with functional assays that are not directly linked with the in vivo potential or gene regulatory mechanisms. Here we comprehensively identify myeloid progenitor subpopulations by transcriptional sorting of single cells from the bone marrow. We describe multiple progenitor subgroups showing unexpected transcriptional priming towards seven differentiation fates, but no progenitors with a mixed state. Transcriptional differentiation is correlated with combinations of known and previously undefined transcription factors, suggesting the process is tightly regulated. Histone maps and knockout assays are consistent with the transcriptional states while traditional transplantation experiments are only partially overlapping myeloid transcriptional priming. Our analyses uncover the function of the underlying regulatory mechanisms for several sub groups and establishes a general framework for dissecting hematopoiesis.

Title: Single Cell Transcriptomics Reveals Multi-Dimensional Heterogeneity in Early Hematopoietic Precursors 
Summary: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and multipotent progenitors (MPPs) are at the apex of the hematopoietic hierarchy. The relationship among HSC and MPPs, their heterogeneity and regulation are challenging subjects of continuing study. We performed single-cell RNA-seq on HSC and their immediate progeny MPP1 cells and compared results with bulk RNA-seq data from 18 hematopoietic populations, literature compilations of cell cycle-related genes, lineage specific genes, and putative quiescence genes. HSC and MPP1 were separated into several distinct subsets including actively cycling, quiescent and a putative hibernating subset. The quiescent cells preferentially expressed lymphoid precursor genes, while in actively cycling cells, the relative level of genes specific for individual lineages were differently correlated with stages of cell cycle. Granulocytic/monocytic and megakaryocytic precursor mRNA levels rose in early G1 phase, while erythroid specific expression showed selective augmentation at the G2/M phase. Stimulation of erythropoiesis shifted most HSCs into the active cell fraction without a disproportionate increase in the expression of early erythroid genes. Most transcription factors of the hematopoietic lineages were randomly expressed in a number of the early precursor cells but certain transcription factor mRNAs were detected only in very few cells. The latter genes may act as valves controlling the flow of differentiation. In summary we detect multi-level heterogeneity of the earliest hematopoietic precursor cells, demonstrate novel lineage specific cell cycle effects on the expression of precursor genes, and find that key regulatory genes for stages of differentiation can be identified from their silencing in stem cells.

Title: Single-Cell RNA-seq Defines the Three Cell Lineages of the Human Blastocyst 
Summary: Here we provide fundamental insights into early human development by single-cell RNA-sequencing of human and mouse preimplantation embryos. We elucidate conserved transcriptional programs along with those that are human-specific. Importantly, we validate our RNA-sequencing findings at the protein level, which further reveals differences in human and mouse embryo gene expression. For example, we identify several genes exclusively expressed in the human pluripotent epiblast including the transcription factor KLF17. Key components of the TGF-β signaling pathway including NODAL, GDF3, TGFBR1/ALK5, LEFTY1, SMAD2, SMAD4 and TDGF1 are also enriched in the human epiblast. Intriguingly, inhibition of TGF-β signaling abrogates NANOG expression in human epiblast cells, consistent with a requirement for this pathway in pluripotency. Although key trophectoderm factors Id2, Elf5, and Eomes are exclusively localized to this lineage in the mouse, the human orthologues are either absent or expressed in alternative lineages. Importantly, we also identify genes with conserved expression dynamics including Foxa2/FOXA2, which we show is restricted to the primitive endoderm in both human and mouse embryos. Comparisons of the human epiblast to existing embryonic stem cells (hESCs) reveals conservation of pluripotency but also additional pathways more enriched in hESCs. Our analysis highlights significant differences in human preimplantation development compared to mouse and provides a molecular blueprint to understand human embryogenesis and its relationship to stem cells.

Title: Transcriptome profiling reveals roles of meristem regulators and polarity genes during multicellular fruit trichome development in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.). 
Summary: Trichomes are the hair-like structures that are widely present on the surface of aerial organs and function in plant defense against biotic and abiotic stresses. Previous studies focus on the single cell trichomes in Arabidopsis and cotton, or multicellular glandular trichomes in tomato, but the developmental process and molecular mechanisms controlling multicellular non-glandular trichome development are largely neglected. Here, we extensively characterized the fruit trichome (spine) development in wild type cucumber and in a tiny branched hair (tbh) mutant that contains a spontaneous mutation and has hairless foliage and smooth fruit surface. Our data indicated that cucumber trichome was multicellular and non-glandular, with no branches or endoreduplication. Further, the major feature of cucumber trichome development was spine base expansion. Transcriptome profiling through Digital Gene Expression indicated that meristem-related genes and transcription factors were implicated in the fruit spine development, and polarity regulators were upregulated during spine base expansion. qRT-PCR verified the reliability of our RNA-SEQ data, and in situ hybridization confirmed the enriched expression of meristem regulators CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON3 (CUC3) and STM (SHOOT MERISTEMLESS) , as well as the abaxial identity gene KANADI (KAN) in cucumber fruit spine. Together, our results suggest a distinct regulatory pathway involving meristem genes and polarity regulators in multicellular trichome development in cucumber.

Title: Chromatin decompaction coupled MuERVL endogenous retrovirus activation induces genome-wide DNA demethylation 
Summary: Mouse embryonic stem cells are heterogeneous and contain rare cells expressing transcripts normally upregulated in pre-implantation embryos, including the Zscan4 cluster and MuERVL endogenous retrovirus. Through single cell transcriptomics and genome-wide chromatin and DNA methylation analyses we uncover the dynamics of the regulation and epigenetic consequences of these transient cells. Transcriptional activation of MuERVL and Zscan4 coincided with a global increase in chromatin accessibility. Through a combination of bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, we reveal the dynamics and specificities of a MuERVL driven transcriptional network. Interestingly, in addition to pre-implantation embryos, the MuERVL network is similarly upregulated during somatic cell reprogramming, associating it with dramatic chromatin remodeling events. In MuERVL+ mESCs, upregulation of a cluster of Eif1A-like genes results in inhibition of protein synthesis, uncoupling transcription from translation. Consequently, depletion of proteins including DNA methyltransferases, results in genome-wide DNA demethylation, demonstrating the influence of endogenous retroviral activation on the host epigenome.

Title: Multiplex Single Cell Profiling of Chromatin Accessibility by Combinatorial Cellular Indexing [RNA-seq] 
Summary: Technical advances have enabled the collection of genome and transcriptome data sets with single-cell resolution. However, single-cell characterization of the epigenome has remained challenging. Furthermore, because cells must be physically separated prior to biochemical processing, conventional single-cell preparatory methods scale linearly. We applied combinatorial cellular indexing to measure chromatin accessibility in thousands of single cells per assay, circumventing the need for compartmentalization of individual cells. We report chromatin accessibility profiles from over 15,000 single cells and use these data to cluster cells on the basis of chromatin accessibility landscapes. We identify modules of coordinately regulated chromatin accessibility at the level of single cells both between and within cell types, with a scalable method that may accelerate progress toward a human cell atlas.

Title: Microglia development follows a stepwise program to regulate brain homeostasis - RNA seq 
Summary: Microglia play important roles in life-long brain maintenance and in pathology, but are also crucial in the developing central nervous system; yet their regulatory dynamics during development have not been fully elucidated. Genome-wide chromatin and expression profiling coupled with single-cell transcriptomic analysis throughout development reveal that microglia undergo three temporal developmental stages in synchrony with the brain: early, pre-, and adult microglia, which are under the control of distinct regulatory circuits. Knockout of the transcription factor MafB caused disruption of homeostasis in adulthood and increased inflammation. Environmental perturbations, such as the microbiome or prenatal immune activation, led to dysregulation of the developmental program, particularly in terms of inflammation. Together, our work identifies a stepwise developmental program of microglia integrating immune response pathways that may be associated with several neurodevelopmental disorders.

Title: Hepatitis C virus functionally sequesters miR-122 [miR-122 KO vs Control CLIP] 
Summary: Hepatitis C virus uniquely requires the liver specific microRNA-122 for replication, yet global effects on endogenous miRNA targets during infection are unexplored. Here, high-throughput sequencing and crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) experiments of human Argonaute (Ago) during HCV infection showed robust Ago binding on the HCV 5’UTR, at known and predicted miR-122 sites. On the human transcriptome, we observed reduced Ago binding and functional mRNA de-repression of miR-122 targets during virus infection. This miR-122 “sponge” effect could be relieved and redirected to miR-15 targets by swapping the miRNA tropism of the virus. Single-cell expression data from reporters containing miR-122 sites showed significant de-repression during HCV infection depending on expression level and number of sites. We describe a quantitative mathematical model of HCV induced miR-122 sequestration and propose that such miR-122 inhibition by HCV RNA may result in global de-repression of host miR-122 targets, providing an environment fertile for the long-term oncogenic potential of HCV.

Title: Single-cell RNA-seq with Waterfall Reveals Molecular Cascades underlying Adult Hippocampal Neurogenesis 
Summary: Somatic stem cells contribute to tissue ontogenesis, homeostasis, and regeneration through sequential processes. Systematic molecular analysis of stem cell behavior is challenging because classic approaches cannot resolve cellular heterogeneity or capture developmental dynamics. Here we provide a comprehensive resource of single-cell transcriptomes of adult hippocampal quiescent neural stem cells (qNSCs) and their immediate progeny. We further developed Waterfall, a bioinformatic suite, to statistically quantify singe-cell gene expression along de novo reconstructed continuous developmental trajectory. Our study reveals molecular signatures of qNSCs, characterized by high niche signaling integration and low protein translation capacity. Our analyses further delineate molecular cascades underlying adult qNSC activation and neurogenesis initiation, exemplified by decreased extrinsic signaling capacity, primed translational machinery, and regulatory switches in transcription factors, metabolism, and energy sources. Our study reveals the molecular continuum underlying adult neurogenesis and illustrates how Waterfall can be used for single-cell omics analyses of various continuous biological processes.

Title: Gene expression analysis of lung fibroblasts in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis 
Summary: We conducted fibroblast-specific transcriptome analysis by next generation sequencing in order to investigate qualitative change and activation signatures of lung fibroblasts in bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Lung fibroblasts were identified by using reporter mice of collagen-α2(I), in which collagen I-producing fibroblasts were labeled with EGFP. Lungs were dissociated with protease sollution, and single cell suspension were stained with lineage markers (Ter119, CD45, CD31, EpCAM). Lineage- GFP+ cells were sorted out and mRNA was collected. Using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) method, we identified 2,973,937 SAGE tags (1,080,798 tags from saline-treated GFP+ fibroblasts and 1,893,139 tags from bleomycin-treated GFP+ fibroblasts). We found that genes related to extracellular matrix construction were highly up-regulated in fibroblasts from belomycin-treated lungs. Moreover, an analysis of mRNA profiles revealed biological functions such as proliferation, invasion, adhesion, and migration were promoted in fibroblasts from bleomycin-treated lung, which recapitulated the role of fibroblasts in the fibrogenesis. These fibroblast-specific gene expression profiles will be important notions in future fibrosis studies.

Title: Microglia development follows a stepwise program to regulate brain homeostasis - Single Cell RNA-seq

Title: hiPSCs unravel aberrant TGFβ signaling as an etiology of left ventricular non-compaction 
Summary: Left ventricular non-compaction (LVNC) is the third most prevalent cardiomyopathy in children and has a unique phenotype with characteristically extensive hypertrabeculation of the left ventricle, similar to the embryonic left ventricle, suggesting a developmental defect of the embryonic myocardium. However, studying this disease has been challenging due to the lack of an animal model that can faithfully recapitulate the clinical phenotype of LVNC. To address this, we show that patient-specific hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC-CMs) generated from a family with LVNC recapitulated a developmental defect consistent with the LVNC phenotype at the single-cell level. We then utilized hiPSC-CMs to show that increased transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) signaling is one of the central mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of LVNC. LVNC hiPSC-CMs demonstrated decreased proliferative capacity due to abnormal activation of TGFβ signaling. Exome sequencing demonstrated a mutation in TBX20, which regulates TGFβ signaling, contributing to the LVNC phenotype. Our results demonstrate that hiPSC-CMs are a useful tool for the exploration of novel mechanisms underlying poorly understood cardiomyopathies such as LVNC. Here we provide the first evidence of activation of TGF signaling as playing a role in the pathogenesis of LVNC.

Title: A developmental coordinate of the spectrum of pluripotency among mice, monkeys, and humans 
Summary: The epiblast (EPI) is the origin of all somatic and germ cells in mammals, and of the spectrum of pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) in vitro. To explore the ontogeny of human/primate pluripotency, we performed comprehensive single-cell RNA sequencing for pre- and post-implantation EPI development in cynomolgus monkeys. Here we show that after specification in the blastocysts [embryonic day (E)7], cyEPI undergoes major transcriptome changes upon implantation. Thereafter, cyEPI, while generating gastrulating cells (~E13), maintains its transcriptome relatively stably over a week, retaining a unique set of pluripotency genes while acquiring properties for “neuron differentiation.” h/cyPSCs show the highest similarity to post-implantation late cyEPI (~E17), which, despite co-existing with gastrulating cells, bears characteristics of pre-gastrulating mouse EPI (E5.5) and epiblast-like cells (EpiLCs) in vitro. These findings not only reveal divergence/coherence of EPI development, but also identify a developmental coordinate of the spectrum of pluripotency among key species, providing a basis for better regulation of human pluripotency in vitro.

Title: Endogenous miRNA and target concentrations determine susceptibility to potential ceRNA competition, based on hierarchical binding affinities (small RNA) 
Summary: Target competition (ceRNA crosstalk) within miRNA-regulated gene networks has been proposed to influence biological systems. To assess target competition, we characterize and quantitate miRNA networks in two cell types. Argonaute iCLIP reveals that hierarchical binding of high to low affinity miRNA targets is a key characteristic of in vivo activity. Quantification of cellular miRNA and mRNA/ncRNA target pool levels indicates that miRNA-Target pool ratios and an affinity partitioned target pool accurately predict in vivo Ago binding profiles and miRNA susceptibility to target competition. Using single-cell reporters, we directly test predictions and estimate ~3,000 additional high affinity target sites can affect active miRNA families with low endogenous miRNA-Target ratios, such as miR-92/25. In contrast, the highly expressed miR-294 and let-7 families are not susceptible to increases of nearly 10,000 sites. These results show differential susceptibility based on endogenous miRNA-Target pool ratios and provide a physiological context for ceRNA competition in vivo.

Title: Global absolute quantification reveals tight regulation of protein expression in single Xenopus eggs 
Summary: Recent developments in genomic sequencing technology have enabled comprehensive transcriptome analyses of single cells. In contrast, single cell proteomics analyses have been restricted to targeted analyses, for example using flow cytometry with GFP fusions or mass cytometry. Here, we performed global absolute protein quantification of single Xenopus laevis eggs using mass spectrometry-based proteomics. We quantified over 5800 proteins, thus representing the largest single cell proteome that has been characterized to date. Absolute protein amounts in single eggs are highly comparable, thus indicating a tight regulation of global protein abundance. Comparison between the single-cell proteome and transcriptome reveal poor expression correlation. Finally, we identified 439 proteins that significantly change in abundance during early embryogenesis. Many of these proteins do not show regulation at the transcript level. Altogether, our data reveal that the transcriptome is a poor indicator of the proteome and that protein levels are tightly controlled in Xenopus leavis eggs.

Title: A single-cell transcriptomic map of the human and mouse pancreas reveals inter- and intra-cell population structure 
Summary: While the function of the mammalian pancreas hinges on complex interactions of distinct cell types, gene expression profiles have primarily been described with bulk mixtures of cells. Here, we invoked inDrop, a droplet-based single-cell RNA-Seq method, to determine the transcriptomes of over 12,000 individual pancreatic cells from four human donors and two strains of mice. Cells could be divided into 15 clusters that matched previously characterized cell types: all endocrine cell types, including rare ghrelin-expressing epsilon-cells, exocrine cell types, vascular cells, Schwann cells, quiescent and activated pancreatic stellate cells, and four types of immune cells. We detected subpopulations of ductal cells with distinct expression profiles, and validated their existence with immuno-histochemistry stains. Moreover, among human beta-cells, we detected heterogeneity in the regulation of genes relating to functional maturation and levels of ER-stress. Finally, we deconvolve bulk gene expression samples using single-cell RNA-Seq to detect disease associated differential expression. Thus, our cross-species dataset provides a resource for the discovery of novel cell type-specific and cell type-restricted transcription factors, signaling receptors, and medically-relevant genes.

Title: Stochastic genome - nuclear lamina contacts are linked to histone H3K9 dimethylation (RNA-seq data) 
Summary: The nuclear lamina (NL) interacts with hundreds of large genomic regions termed lamina-associated domains (LADs). The dynamics of these interactions and the relation to epigenetic modifications are poorly understood. We visualized the fate of LADs in single cells using a novel 'molecular contact memory' approach. In each interphase nucleus, only ~30% of LADs are positioned at the periphery; these LADs are in intermittent molecular contact with the NL but remain constrained to the periphery. Upon mitosis, LAD positioning is not detectably inherited but instead is stochastically reshuffled. Contact of individual LADs with the NL correlates with their degree of H3K9 dimethylation in single cells, and inactivation of the H3K9 methyltransferase G9a reduces the NL contact frequencies. These results indicate that nuclear positioning and histone modification of LADs are both stochastic yet linked in single cells. Collectively, these results highlight principles of the dynamic spatial architecture of chromosomes.

Here, high-throughput sequencing and crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) experiments of human Argonaute (Ago) during HCV infection showed robust Ago binding on the HCV 5’UTR, at known and predicted miR-122 sites. On the human transcriptome, we observed reduced Ago binding and functional mRNA de-repression of miR-122 targets during virus infection.

Single-cell expression data from reporters containing miR-122 sites showed significant de-repression during HCV infection depending on expression level and number of sites. We describe a quantitative mathematical model of HCV induced miR-122 sequestration and propose that such miR-122 inhibition by HCV RNA may result in global de-repression of host miR-122 targets, providing an environment fertile for the long-term oncogenic potential of HCV.

Title: A distinct gene module uncouples dysfunction from activation in tumor-infiltrating T cells (part 2) 
Summary: Reversing the dysfunctional T cell state that arises in cancer and chronic viral infections is the focus of therapeutic interventions; however, current therapies are effective in only some patients and some tumor types. To gain a deeper molecular understanding of the dysfunctional T cell state, we analyzed population and single-cell RNA profiles of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and used genetic perturbations to identify a distinct gene module for T cell dysfunction that can be uncoupled from T cell activation. This distinct dysfunction module is downstream of intracellular metallothioneins that regulate zinc metabolism and can be identified at single-cell resolution. We further identify Gata-3, a zinc-finger transcription factor in the dysfunctional module, as a regulator of dysfunction, and use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to show that it drives a dysfunctional phenotype in CD8+ TILs. Our results open novel avenues for targeting dysfunctional T cell states, while leaving activation programs intact.

Title: Single-cell RNA-Seq reveals dynamic, random monoallelic gene expression in mammalian cells 
Summary: In the diploid genome, genes come in two copies, which can have different DNA sequence and where one is maternal and one is paternal. In a particular cell, a gene could potentially be expressed from both copies (biallelic expression) or only one (monoallelic). We performed RNA-Sequencing on individual cells, from zygote to the cells of the late blastocyst, and also individual cells from the adult liver. Using first generation crosses between two distantly related mouse strains, CAST/Ei and C57BL/6, we determined the expression separately from the maternal and paternal alleles. We found that half of the genes were expressed by only one allele, randomly so that some cells would express the paternal allele, some the maternal and a few cell both alleles. We also observed the spread of the progressive inactivation of the paternal X chromosome.

Title: Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency transforms Flt3-ITD myeloproliferative disease into a rapid, spontaneous, and fully-penetrant acute myeloid leukemia (Single Cell RNA-Seq) 
Summary: Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML) represents nearly 50% of human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cases with a 5-year overall survival of approximately 30%. In CN-AML with poorer prognosis, mutations in the de novo DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3A) and the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (Flt3) commonly co-occur (1-3). We demonstrate that mice with Flt3-internal-tandem duplication (Flt3ITD) and inducible deletion of Dnmt3a spontaneously develop a rapidly-lethal, completely-penetrant, and transplantable AML of normal karyotype. These murine AML retain a single Dnmt3a floxed allele, revealing the oncogenic potential of Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency. FLT3-ITD/DNMT3A-mutant primary human and murine AML demonstrate a similar pattern of global DNA methylation. In the murine model, rescuing DNMT3A expression was accompanied by DNA re-methylation and loss of clonogenic potential, suggesting that Dnmt3a-mutant oncogenic effects are reversible. Differentially methylated genomic regions were associated with changes in the expression of nearby genes. Moreover, dissection of the cellular architecture of the AML model using single-cell RNA-Seq, flow cytometry and colony assays identified clonogenic subpopulations that differentially express genes that are sensitive to the methylation of nearby genomic loci and varied in response to Dnmt3a levels. Thus, Dnmt3a haploinsufficiency transforms Flt3ITD myeloproliferative disease by modulating methylation-sensitive gene expression within a clonogenic AML subpopulation.

Title: Single-Cell mRNA Sequencing Reveals Rare Intestinal Cell Types 
Summary: Understanding the development and function of an organ requires the characterization of all of its cell types. Traditional methods for visualizing and isolating sub-populations of cells are based on mRNA or protein expression of only few known marker genes. The unequivocal identification of a specific marker gene, however, poses a major challenge, particularly if this cell type is rare. Identifying rare cell types, such as stem cells, short-lived progenitors, cancer stem cells, or circulating tumor cells is crucial to acquire a better understanding of normal or diseased tissue biology. To address this challenge we sequenced the transcriptome of hundreds of randomly selected cells from mouse intestinal organoids, cultured self-organizing epithelial structures that contain all cell lineages of the mammalian intestine. Organoid buds, like intestinal crypts, harbor stem cells that continuously differentiate into a variety of cell types, occurring at widely different abundances. Since available computational methods can only resolve more abundant cell types, we developed RaceID, an algorithm for rare cell type identification in complex populations of single cells. We demonstrate that this algorithm can resolve cell types represented by only a single cell in a population of randomly sampled organoid cells. We use this algorithm to identify Reg4 as a novel marker for enteroendocrine cells, a rare population of hormone producing intestinal cells. Next, we use Reg4 expression to enrich for these rare cells and investigate the heterogeneity within this population. Reassuringly, RaceID confirmed the existence of known enteroendocrine lineages, and moreover, discovered novel subtypes, which we subsequently validated in vivo. Having validated RaceID by this proof-of-principle experiment we then apply the algorithm to ex vivo isolated LGR5 positive cells and their direct progeny and demonstrate homogeneity of the stem cell pool. We envision broad applicability of our method for discovering rare cell types and the corresponding marker genes in healthy and diseased organs.

Title: Transcriptome of mouse preimplantation development [Rlim KO] 
Summary: Purpose: The goals of this study are to establish a roadmap of XCI and compare the transcriptomes of WT and Rlim KO embryos during X chromosome inactivation. Methods: mRNA profiles of 175 preimplantation embryos WT and KO for Rlim were elucidated by RNA-seq at various stages. Trophoblasts isolated from blastocyst outgrowths were also included. The sequence reads that samples where gender could be determined and that passed quality filters were analyzed at the level of autosomes, X xhromosomes as well as single genes. Results: Using single cell RNA-seq technology on 175 whole preimplantation embryos, we obtained about 2.95 million sequence reads per sample. Reads were normalized to autosomal gene expression. Gender of each embryo was determined by expression of Y-linked genes and Xist. Data analysis showed normal expression profiles of marker genes for epiblast and trophoblast cell types during preimplantation development. Comparing Xist expression profiles in embryos WT and KO shows that Rlim is not required for initiation of Xist transcription but for upregulation of Xist expression. Moreover, our results identify two waves of XCI during preimplantation development: One that occurs at Morula stages that is Rlim-independent and one at blastocyst stages that in dependent on Rlim. Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed mouse preimplantation transcriptome. Our results show that Rlim is required for a second wave of imprinted XCI that occurs in female embryos at blastocyst stages.

Title: Single Cell Analysis Reveals Unexpected Transcriptional Heterogeneity of Neural Progenitors in the Developing Human Cortex 
Summary: The human cerebral cortex depends for its normal development and size on a precisely controlled balance between self-renewal and differentiation of diverse neural progenitor cells. Specialized progenitors that are common in humans, but virtually absent in rodents, called ‘outer radial glia’ (ORG), have been suggested to be crucial to the evolutionary expansion of the human cortex. We combined cell type-specific sorting with transcriptome-wide RNA-sequencing to identify genes enriched in human ORG, including targets of the transcription factor Neurogenin, and previously uncharacterized, evolutionarily dynamic, long noncoding RNAs. Single-cell transcriptional profiling of human, ferret, and mouse progenitors showed that more human RGC co-express proneural Neurogenin targets than in ferret or mouse, suggesting greater self-renewal of neuronal lineage-committed progenitors in humans. Finally, we show that activating the Neurogenin pathway in ferret RGC promotes delamination and outward migration. Thus, we find that the abundance of human ORG is paralleled by increased transcriptional heterogeneity of cortical progenitors.

Title: RNA-Seq analysis of 4N and 2N RPE1 cells following polyploid induction via cytokinesis failure or Aurora kinase inhibition [tpo3] 
Summary: Tetraploidization, or genome doubling, is a prominent event in tumorigenesis, primarily because cell division in polyploid cells is error-prone and produces aneuploid cells. This study investigates changes in gene expression evoked in acute and adapted tetraploid cells and their impact on cell-cycle progression. Acute polyploidy was generated by knockdown of essential regulator of cytokinesis Anillin, which resulted in cytokinesis failure and formation of binucleate cells, or by chemical inhibition of Aurora kinases, causing abnormal mitotic exit with formation of single cells with aberrant nuclear morphology. Transcriptome analysis of these acute tetraploid cells revealed common signatures of activation of the tumor-suppressor protein p53. Suppression of proliferation in these cells was dependent on p53 and its transcriptional target - Cdk inhibitor p21. Rare proliferating tetraploid cells can emerge from acute polyploid populations. Gene expression analysis of single-cell derived, adapted tetraploid clones showed upregulation of several p53 target genes and cyclin D2, the activator of Cdk4/6/2. Overexpression of cyclin D2 in diploid cells strongly potentiated the ability to proliferate with increased DNA content despite the presence of functional p53. These results point out that p53-mediated suppression of proliferation of polyploid cells can be averted by increased levels of oncogenes such as Cyclin D2, elucidating a possible route for tetraploidy-mediated genomic instability in carcinogenesis.

Title: MERVL/Zscan4 network activation results in transient genome-wide DNA demethylation of mESCs 
Summary: Mouse embryonic stem cells are heterogeneous and contain rare cells expressing transcripts normally upregulated in pre-implantation embryos, including the Zscan4 cluster and MuERVL endogenous retrovirus. Through single cell transcriptomics and genome-wide chromatin and DNA methylation analyses we uncover the dynamics of the regulation and epigenetic consequences of these transient cells. Transcriptional activation of MuERVL and Zscan4 coincided with a global increase in chromatin accessibility. Through a combination of bulk and single-cell RNA-sequencing, we reveal the dynamics and specificities of a MuERVL driven transcriptional network. Interestingly, in addition to pre-implantation embryos, the MuERVL network is similarly upregulated during somatic cell reprogramming, associating it with dramatic chromatin remodeling events. In MuERVL+ mESCs, upregulation of a cluster of Eif1A-like genes results in inhibition of protein synthesis, uncoupling transcription from translation. Consequently, depletion of proteins including DNA methyltransferases, results in genome-wide DNA demethylation, demonstrating the influence of endogenous retroviral activation on the host epigenome.

Title: Hepatitis C virus functionally sequesters miR-122 [RNA-Seq] 
Summary: Hepatitis C virus uniquely requires the liver specific microRNA-122 for replication, yet global effects on endogenous miRNA targets during infection are unexplored. Here, high-throughput sequencing and crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) experiments of human Argonaute (Ago) during HCV infection showed robust Ago binding on the HCV 5’UTR, at known and predicted miR-122 sites. On the human transcriptome, we observed reduced Ago binding and functional mRNA de-repression of miR-122 targets during virus infection. This miR-122 “sponge” effect could be relieved and redirected to miR-15 targets by swapping the miRNA tropism of the virus. Single-cell expression data from reporters containing miR-122 sites showed significant de-repression during HCV infection depending on expression level and number of sites. We describe a quantitative mathematical model of HCV induced miR-122 sequestration and propose that such miR-122 inhibition by HCV RNA may result in global de-repression of host miR-122 targets, providing an environment fertile for the long-term oncogenic potential of HCV.

Title: Expression profiles of long non-coding RNAs located in autoimmune disease-associated regions reveal immune cell type specificity 
Summary: Background: Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified hundreds of variants associated with risk of autoimmune and immune-related disorders (AID), our understanding of the diseases mechanisms is limited. In particular, more than 90% of the risk variants lie in non-coding regions, and almost 10% of these map to long non-coding RNA transcripts (lncRNAs). LncRNAs are known to show more cell-type specificity than protein-coding genes. Methods: In this study, we aimed to characterize lncRNAs and protein-coding genes located in loci associated with nine AID which have been well-defined by Immunochip analysis, by transcriptome analysis across seven peripheral blood leukocyte populations (granulocytes, monocytes, NK cells, B-cells, memory-T cells, naive CD4+ and naive CD8+ T-cells) and four cord blood derived T-helper cell populations (precursor, primary, polarized (Th1, Th2) T-helper cells). Results: We show that lncRNAs mapping to loci shared between AIDs are significantly enriched in immune cell types when compared to lncRNAs from the whole genome (α<0.005). We were not able to prioritize single cell types relevant for specific diseases, but we observed five cell types enriched (α<0.005) in five AID (NK cells for inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis; memory-T and CD8+ T-cells in juvenile idiopathic arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis; Th0 and Th2 cells for inflammatory bowel disease, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis). Furthermore we show that co-expression analyses of lncRNAs and protein-coding genes can predict the signaling pathways in which these AID-associated lncRNAs are involved. Conclusions: The observed enrichment of lncRNA transcripts in AID loci implies an important role for lncRNAs in AID etiology and suggests that lncRNA genes should be studied in more detail to correctly interpret GWAS findings. The co-expression results strongly support a model in which the lncRNA and protein-coding genes function together in the same pathways.

Title: Snapshot and temporal scRNA-seq of progenitor cells to dissect human embryonic stem cells entry into endoderm progenitors 
Summary: Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) offer a unique cellular model to study lineage specifications of the primary germ layers during human development. We profiled single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on four lineage-specific progenitor cells derived from hESCs. Our scRNA-seq analyses revealed each type of progenitors display various extend of heterogeneity. Specifically, definitive endoderm cells (DECs) not only show a greater degree of heterogeneity, but are also enriched in metabolic signatures. Followed by detailed temporal scRNA-seq profiling along DEC differentiation, we reconstructed a differentiation trajectory using a novel statistical pipeline named Wave-Crest. Wave-Crest further identifies candidate regulators during the transitioning phase from Brachyury (T)+ mesendoderm towards CXCR4+ DEC state. To functionally test identified novel regulators; we generated a live cell monitoring system, a T-2A-EGFP knock-in reporter cell line via CRISPR/CAS9. We demonstrated that, among the top candidate genes, KLF8 plays a pivotal role modulating mesendoderm to DEC differentiation.

Summary: We present a comprehensive transcriptome of ciliate T. thermophila using the Illumina RNA-seq platform. The data was generated from the six mRNA samples of growth, starvation and conjugation of Tetrahymena. Despite an AT rich genome, there are about 124.6 million reads mapped to T. thermophila genome. Using these mapped reads, we have significantly improved the previous genome annotation and investigated the gene expression. Besides, our result also provided a comprehensive understanding of the alternative splicing in T. thermophila, and suggested the existence of the regulated unproductive splicing and translation (RUST) in the single-celled eukaryote.

Title: In silico lineage tracing through single cell transcriptomes identifies a neural stem cell population in planarians 
Summary: Background: The planarian, Schmidtea mediterranea, is a master regenerator with a large adult stem cell compartment. The lack of transgenic labeling techniques in this animal have hindered the study of lineage progression and has made understanding the mechanisms of tissue replacement during regeneration a challenge. However, recent advances in single cell transcriptomics and analysis methods may allow for the discovery of novel cell lineages as differentiation progresses from stem cell to terminally differentiated cell. Here we apply Waterfall analysis and single cell transcriptomics to identify adult stem cells belonging to specific cellular lineages and identify novel candidate genes for future in vivo lineage studies. Results: Single-cell-RNA-deep sequencing (scRNAseq) of 168 purified single stem and progeny cells from the planarian head was used to identify a molecularly distinct, neural stem cell population (νNeoblasts). Hierarchical clustering revealed 10 distinct subgroups and pseudotime analysis with Waterfall predicted a neural lineage trajectory as well as a novel alternative lineage. Previously undescribed neural lineage genes identified in silico were characterized in vivo and were shown to have neural expression patterns. Using the predicted νNeoblast markers, we demonstrate that a novel piwi-2+piwi-1lo stem cell population exists adjacent to the brain and immediately takes up BrdU. Conclusions: scRNAseq coupled with in silico lineage analysis offers a new approach for studying lineage progression in planarians. The lineages identified here were extracted from a highly heterogeneous dataset with minimal prior knowledge of planarian lineages, demonstrating that lineage purification by transgenic labelling is not a prerequisite for this approach. The identification of the νNeoblast lineage demonstrates the usefulness of the planarian system for computationally predicting cellular lineages in an adult context coupled with in vivo verification.

Title: Flexible multiplatform RNA profiling at the single cell level applied to enriched cancer initiating cells: RNA-Seq CIC data 
Summary: Accurate profiling of RNA expression of single cells is a valuable approach for broadening our understanding of cancer biology and mechanisms of dissemination, but requires the development of reliable methods for their molecular characterization. Here we evaluate a single cell methodology which generates microgram amounts of cDNA suitable for next generation sequencing (RNA-Seq), high throughput RT-qPCR and Affymetrix array analysis. The approach was tested by comparing expression profiles of amplified single MCF7 and MCF10A cells to profiles generated from unamplified RNA. The expression profiles were compared by Affymetrix-U133 arrays, RNA-Seq and high-density qPCR. There were strong cross-platform correlations of >80% and concordance between single cell and unamplified material of >70%. We exemplify the approach through analysis of rare sorted cancer initiating cells (CICs) derived from a NSCLC patient-derived xenograft. Populations of 10 cells from total tumour and two distinct subsets of CIC, putatively involved in primary tumor maintenance or metastasis formation were FACS sorted then directly amplified. CIC expression profiles strongly correlated with published stem-cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signatures. Our results confirm the utility of the amplification system and our methodology to detect and distinguish RNA profiles in rare cell populations that inform on EMT and stem-cell characteristics. This GEO dataset comprises the RNA-Seq data for total tumour, MCIC and RCIC samples.

Title: Combined ultra-low input mRNA and whole-genome sequencing from human embryonic stem cells 
Summary: Next Generation Sequencing has proven to be an exceptionally powerful tool in the field of genomics and transcriptomics. With recent development it is nowadays possible to analyze ultra-low input sample material down to single cells. Nevertheless investigating such sample material still limits the analysis to either the genome or transcriptome, hence a combined analysis of both types of nucleic acids from the same sample material is still in demand.We developed a protocol which enables the combined analysis of the genome as well as the transcriptome by Next Generation Sequencing from ultra-low input samples. The protocol was evaluated by sequencing sub-colony structures from human embryonic stem cells containing 150 to 200 cells. The method can be adapted to any available sequencing system (e.g. Illumina, SOLiD, 454, etc.).To our knowledge, this is the first report where sub-colonies of human embryonic stem cells have been analyzed both at the genomic as well as transcriptome level. The method of this proof of concept study may find useful practical applications for cases where only a limited number of cells are available, e.g. for tissues samples from biopsies, circulating tumor cells and cells from early embryonic development. The results we present demonstrate that a combined analysis of genomic DNA and messenger RNA from ultra low input samples is feasible and can readily be applied to other cellular systems with limited material available.

Title: In vitro cultured H7 human embryonic stem cells (WiCell) and H7-derived downstream early mesoderm progenitors 
Summary: Stem-cell differentiation to desired lineages requires navigating alternating developmental paths that often lead to unwanted cell types. Hence, comprehensive developmental roadmaps are crucial to channel stem-cell differentiation toward desired fates. To this end, here, we map bifurcating lineage choices leading from pluripotency to 12 human mesodermal lineages, including bone, muscle, and heart. We defined the extrinsic signals controlling each binary lineage decision, enabling us to logically block differentiation toward unwanted fates and rapidly steer pluripotent stem cells toward 80%–99% pure human mesodermal lineages at most branchpoints. This strategy enabled the generation of human bone and heart progenitors that could engraft in respective in vivo models. Mapping stepwise chromatin and single-cell gene expression changes in mesoderm development uncovered somite segmentation, a previously unobservable human embryonic event transiently marked by HOPX expression. Collectively, this roadmap enables navigation of mesodermal development to produce transplantable human tissue progenitors and uncover developmental processes. doi:10.1016/j.cell.2016.06.011

Title: Integrative Single-Cell Transcriptomics Reveals Molecular Networks Defining Neuronal Maturation during Neurogenesis 
Summary: Neurogenesis in the adult hippocampus contributes to information processing critical for cognition, adaptation, learning and memory, and is implicated in numerous neurological disorders. New neurons are continuously produced from neural stem cells via a well-controlled developmental process. The immature neuron stage defined by doublecortin (DCX) expression is the most sensitive to regulation by extrinsic factors. However, little is known about the dynamic biology within this critical interval that drives maturation and confers susceptibility to regulating signals. This study aims to test the hypothesis that DCX-expressing immature neurons in adult mouse hippocampus progress through developmental stages via activity of specific transcriptional networks. Using single-cell RNA-seq combined with a novel integrative bioinformatics approach, we discovered that individual immature neuron can be classified into distinct developmental subgroups based on characteristic gene expression profiles and subgroup-specific markers. Comparisons between immature and more mature subgroups revealed novel pathways involved in neuronal maturation. Genes enriched in more immature cells shared significant overlap with genes implicated in neurodegenerative diseases, while genes positively associated with neuronal maturation were enriched for autism-related gene sets. Our study thus discovers molecular signatures of individual adult-born immature neurons and unveils potential novel targets for therapeutic approaches to treat neurodevelopmental and neurological diseases.

Title: Single-Cell Analysis Uncovers Clonal Acinar Cell Heterogeneity in the Adult Pancreas 
Summary: Acinar cells make up the majority of all cells in the pancreas, yet the source of new acinar cells during homeostasis remains unknown. Using multicolor lineage-tracing and organoid-formation assays, we identified the presence of a progenitor-like acinar cell subpopulation. These cells have long-term self-renewal capacity, albeit in a unipotent fashion. We further demonstrate that binuclear acinar cells are terminally differentiated acinar cells. Transcriptome analysis of single acinar cells revealed the existence of a minor population of cells expressing progenitor markers. Interestingly, a gain of the identified markers accompanied by a transient gain of proliferation was observed following chemically induced pancreatitis. Altogether, our study identifies a functionally and molecularly distinct acinar subpopulation and thus transforms our understanding of the acinar cell compartment as a pool of equipotent secretory cells.

Title: Tracing the formation of hematopoietic stem cells in mouse embryos by single-cell functional and RNA-Seq analyses [10-cell] 
Summary: Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) in adult are specified early from the endothelium-derived precursors (e.g., hemogenic endothelium, and pre-HSCs) in mouse mid-gestation embryos, the detailed process, however, is still largely unknown due to their rareness, transience, and current inability to prospectively isolate them efficiently . Here we developed a potent set of surface markers that could capture the earliest emerging HSCs, the CD45- pre-HSCs with high accuracy and purity, as rigorously and functionally verified by single-cell-initiated serial transplantation assays. Then we applied single-cell RNA-Seq technique to analyze five populations related to HSC formation: the CD45- (type 1) and CD45+ (type 2) pre-HSCs as well as endothelial cells in the E11 AGM region; and later mature HSCs in the E12 and E14 fetal livers. Compared to other cell populations, both type 1 and type 2 pre-HSCs have their unique signatures of transcription machinery, transcription factor network, signaling pathway, cell cycle status, metabolism state, and lncRNA expression patterns. Our work paves the way for dissection of the complex molecular mechanisms regulating the step-wise formation of HSCs from endothelial cells, thus informing future efforts on engineering HSCs for clinical application.

Title: Expression data from Uninfected and BRAF600V induced melanocytes 
Summary: Melanocytes within benign human nevi are the paradigm for tumor suppressive senescent cells in a pre-malignant neoplasm. These cells typically contain mutations in either the BRAF or N-RAS oncogene and express markers of senescence, including p16. However, a nevus can contain 10s to 100s of thousands of clonal melanocytes and approximately 20-30% of melanoma are thought to arise in association with a pre-existing nevus. Neither observation is indicative of fail-safe senescence-associated proliferation arrest and tumor suppression. We set out to better understand the status of nevus melanocytes. Proliferation-promoting Wnt target genes, such as cyclin D1 and c-myc, were repressed in oncogene-induced senescent melanocytes in vitro, and repression of Wnt signaling in these cells induced a senescent-like state. In contrast, cyclin D1 and c-myc were expressed in many melanocytes of human benign nevi. Specifically, activated Wnt signalling in nevi correlated inversely with nevus maturation, an established dermatopathological correlate of clinical benignancy. Single cell analyses of lone epidermal melanocytes and nevus melanocytes showed that expression of proliferation-promoting Wnt targets correlates with prior proliferative expansion of p16-expressing nevus melanocytes. In a mouse model, activation of Wnt signaling delayed, but did not bypass, senescence of oncogene-expressing melanocytes, leading to massive accumulation of proliferation-arrested, p16-positive non-malignant melanocytes. We conclude that clonal hyperproliferation of oncogene-expressing melanocytes to form a nevus is facilitated by transient delay of senescence due to activated Wnt signaling. The observation that activation of Wnt signaling correlates inversely with nevus maturation, an indicator of clinical benignancy, supports the notion that persistent destabilization of senescence by Wnt signaling contributes to the malignant potential of nevi.

Title: Chd1 is essential for the high transcriptional output and rapid growth of the mouse epiblast 
Summary: The pluripotent mammalian epiblast undergoes unusually fast cell proliferation. This rapid growth is expected to generate a high transcriptional demand, but the underlying mechanisms remain unknown. We report that the chromatin remodeler Chd1, which binds the activating histone mark H3K4me3 and is associated with transcription, is required for development of the mouse epiblast. Chd1-/- embryos exhibit proliferation defects and increased apoptosis, are smaller than controls by E5.5, and fail to grow, become patterned or gastrulate. We show that Chd1-/- ES cells have a self-renewal defect and a genome-wide reduction in transcriptional output that is associated with losses in RNA Pol II elongation at growth-promoting genes, including ribosomal proteins. We also report that Chd1 directly regulates ribosomal RNA transcription and that both Chd1-/- epiblast cells in vivo and ES cells in vitro express significantly lower levels of ribosomal RNA. Single cell analyses reveal abnormal nucleolar morphology in mutants in vivo and in vitro. These data indicate that Chd1 promotes a globally elevated transcriptional output required to sustain the distinct rapid growth of the mouse epiblast.

Title: Somatosensory Neuron Types Identified by High-Coverage Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing and Functional Heterogeneity 
Summary: Sensory neurons are distinguished by distinct signaling networks and receptive characteristics. Thus, sensory neuron types can be defined by linking transcriptome-based neuron typing with the sensory phenotypes. Here we classify somatosensory neurons of the mouse dorsal root ganglion (DRG) by high-coverage single-cell RNA-sequencing (10 950 ± 1 218 genes per neuron) and neuron size-based hierarchical clustering. Moreover, single DRG neurons responding to cutaneous stimuli are recorded using an in vivo whole-cell patch clamp technique and classified by neuron-type genetic markers. Small diameter DRG neurons are classified into one type of low-threshold mechanoreceptor and five types of mechanoheat nociceptors (MHNs). Each of the MHN types is further categorized into two subtypes. Large DRG neurons are categorized into four types, including neurexophilin 1-expressing MHNs and mechanical nociceptors (MNs) expressing BAI1-associated protein 2-like 1 (Baiap2l1). Mechanoreceptors expressing trafficking protein particle complex 3-like and Baiap2l1-marked MNs are subdivided into two subtypes each. These results provide a new system for cataloging somatosensory neurons and their transcriptome databases.

Title: Sexual cell fate reprogramming in the ovary by DMRT1 
Summary: Transcription factors related to the insect sex determination gene Doublesex (DMRT proteins) control sex determination and/or sexual differentiation in diverse metazoans. They also are implicated in transitions between sex-determining mechanisms during vertebrate evolution. In mice Dmrt1 is required for male gonadal differentiation in somatic cells and germ cells. DMRT1 also maintains male gonadal sex: its loss, even in adults, can trigger sexual fate reprogramming in which male Sertoli cells transdifferentiate into their female equivalents - granulosa cells - and testicular tissue reorganizes to a more ovarian morphology. Here we use a conditional Dmrt1 transgene to show that Dmrt1 is not only necessary but also sufficient to specify male cell identity in the mouse gonad. DMRT1 expression in the ovary silenced the female sex-maintenance gene Foxl2 and reprogrammed juvenile and adult granulosa cells into Sertoli-like cells, triggering formation of structures resembling male seminiferous tubules. DMRT1 can silence Foxl2 even in the absence of the testis-determining genes Sox8 and Sox9. mRNA profiling found that DMRT1 activates many testicular genes and downregulates ovarian genes and single cell RNA-seq in transdifferentiating cells identified dynamically expressed candidate mediators of this process. Strongly upregulated genes were highly enriched on chromosome X, consistent with sexually antagonistic functions. This study provides an in vivo example of single gene reprogramming of cell sexual identity. Our findings suggest a reconsideration of mechanisms involved in human disorders of sexual development (DSD) and empirically support evolutionary models where loss or gain of Dmrt1 function promotes establishment of new vertebrate sex determination systems.

Title: Single cell analysis of long non-coding RNAs in the developing human neocortex 
Summary: Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) comprise a diverse class of transcripts that can regulate molecular and cellular processes in brain development and diseasee. LncRNAs exhibit cell type- and tissue-specific expression, but little is known about the expression and function of lncRNAs in the developing human brain. Here, we deeply profiled lncRNAs from polyadenylated and total RNA obtained from human neocortex at different stages of development and integrated this resource to analyze the transcriptomes of single cells. While lncRNAs were generally detected at low levels in whole tissues, single cell transcriptomics revealed that many lncRNAs are abundantly expressed in individual cells and are cell type-specific. Furthermore, we used CRISRPi to show that LOC646329, a lncRNA enriched in radial glia but detected at low abundance in tissues, regulates cell proliferation. The discrete and abundant expression of lncRNAs among individual cells has important implications for both their biological function and utility for distinguishing neural cell types.

Title: Genome-wide maps of nuclear lamina interactions in single human cells (CEL-seq) 
Summary: Mammalian interphase chromosomes interact with the nuclear lamina (NL) through hundreds of large Lamina Associated Domains (LADs). We report a method to map NL contacts genome-wide in single human cells. Analysis of ~400 maps reveals a core architecture of gene-poor LADs that contact the NL with high cell-to-cell consistency, interspersed by LADs with more variable NL interactions. The variable contacts are more sensitive to a change in genome ploidy than the consistent contacts. Single-cell maps indicate that NL contacts involve multivalent interactions over hundreds of kilobases. Moreover, we observe extensive intra-chromosomal coordination of NL contacts, even over tens of megabases. Such coordinated loci exhibit preferential interactions as detected by Hi-C. Finally, single-cell gene expression and chromatin accessibility analysis shows that loci with consistent NL contacts are expressed at lower levels and are more consistently inaccessible than loci with lower contact frequencies. These results highlight fundamental principles of single cell chromatin organization.

Title: Cellular Taxonomy of the Mouse Striatum as Revealed by Single-Cell RNAseq 
Summary: The striatum contributes to many cognitive processes and disorders, but its cell types are incompletely characterized. We show that microfluidic and FACS-based single-cell RNA sequencing of mouse striatum provides a well-resolved classification of striatal cell type diversity. Transcriptome analysis revealed 10 differentiated distinct cell types, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, ependymal, immune, and vascular cells, and enabled the discovery of numerous novel marker genes. Furthermore, we identified two discrete subtypes of medium spiny neurons (MSN) which have specific markers and which overexpress genes linked to cognitive disorders and addiction. We also describe continuous cellular identities, which increase heterogeneity within discrete cell types. Finally, we identified cell type specific transcription and splicing factors that shape cellular identities by regulating splicing and expression patterns. Our findings suggest that functional diversity within a complex tissue arises from a small number of discrete cell types, which can exist in a continuous spectrum of functional states.

Title: Single-cell transcriptome profiling for metastatic renal cell carcinoma patient-derived cells [RNA-seq] 
Summary: Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) initiated from the renal epithelium is the most prevalent histological type of adult kidney cancers. Dissecting intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) of ccRCC has leveraged to extend our knowledge on how primary tumors harboring driver mutations evolve and spread to other sites. The cellular fractions within and across the primary (pRCC) and metastatic RCC (mRCC) are heterogeneous in both their genetic and biological features determining the variability in clinical aggressiveness and sensitivity to the therapy. To achieve sustainable therapeutic benefit with targeted agents in mRCC, the effective target should focus on signaling pathways that are related to driver mutations occurred early in the clonal evolution of the disease and thus should be common to primary tumor and metastatic sites. Considering that extensive genetic heterogeneity may result in drug response variability among patients and treatment resistance, the tailored strategies for metastatic RCC is urgently needed. Here, we analyze single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) data from a matched primary RCC (pRCC) and lung metastasis (mRCC) to dissect ITH at the highest resolution to date with the objective of discovering the better therapeutic regimen.

Title: RNA-Seq following PCR-based sorting reveals rare cell transcriptional signatures 
Summary: Background: Rare cell subtypes can profoundly impact the course of human health and disease, yet their presence within a sample is often missed with bulk molecular analysis. Single-cell analysis tools such as FACS, FISH-FC and single-cell barcode-based sequencing can investigate cellular heterogeneity; however, they have significant limitations that impede their ability to identify and transcriptionally characterize many rare cell subpopulations. Results: PCR-activated cell sorting (PACS) is a novel cytometry method that uses single-cell TaqMan PCR reactions performed in microfluidic droplets to identify and isolate cell subtypes with high-throughput. Here, we extend this method and demonstrate that PACS enables high-dimensional molecular profiling on TaqMan-targeted cells. Using a random priming RNA-Seq strategy, we obtained high-fidelity transcriptome measurements following PACS-sorting of prostate cancer cells from a heterogeneous population. The sequencing data revealed prostate cancer gene expression profiles that were obscured in the unsorted populations. Single-cell expression analysis with PACS was subsequently used to confirm a number of the differentially expressed genes identified with RNA sequencing. Conclusions: PACS requires minimal sample processing, uses readily available TaqMan assays and can isolate cell subtypes with high sensitivity. We have now validated a method for performing next-generation sequencing on mRNA obtained from PACS isolated cells. This capability makes PACS well suited for transcriptional profiling of rare cells from complex populations to obtain maximal biological insight into cell states and behaviors.

Title: Localization and Abundance Analysis of Human lncRNAs at Single Cell and Single Molecule Resolution 
Summary: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as key players in different cellular processes and are required for diverse functions in vivo. However, fundamental aspects of lncRNA biology remain poorly characterized, including their subcellular localization, abundance and variation at a single cell resolution. Here, we used single molecule, single-cell RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNA FISH) to survey 61 lncRNAs, chosen by properties such as conservation, tissue specific expression, and expression abundance, and to catalog their abundance and cellular localization patterns in three human cell types. Our lncRNAs displayed diverse sub-cellular localization patterns ranging from strictly nuclear localization to almost exclusive cytoplasmic localization, with the majority localized primarily in the nucleus. The low abundance of these lncRNAs as measured in bulk cell populations cannot be explained by high expression in a small subset of 'jackpot' cells. Simultaneous analysis of lncRNAs and mRNAs from corresponding divergently transcribed loci showed that divergent lncRNAs do not present a distinct localization pattern and are not always co-regulated with their neighbor. Overall, our study highlights important differences and similarities between lncRNAs and mRNAs. The rich set of localization patterns we observe are consistent with a broad range of potential functions for lncRNA, and assists in hypothesis generation for mechanistic studies. Here we provide the RNA-Seq expression matrix, as well as RNA-Seq raw data, which we used for comparison with RNA FISH molecule counts.

Summary: This dataset is part of a study that investigated how the hematopoietic system coordinates the rapid and efficient regeneration of the megakaryocytic lineage during stress scenarios. We found that the phenotypic hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) compartment contains stem-like megakaryocyte-committed progenitors (SL-MkPs), a cell population that shares many features with multipotent HSCs and serves as a lineage-restricted emergency pool for inflammatory insults. This dataset contains single-cell RNA sequencing data of 30 hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells which, in the context of our study, confirmed that MK-specfic transcripts are of highly variable expression in HSCs. The dataset further showed that variations in MK transcript expression in HSCs is not correlated with global transcriptomic rearrangements.

Title: Scalable Microfluidics for Single Cell RNA Printing and Sequencing 
Summary: Single cell transcriptomics has emerged as a powerful approach to dissecting phenotypic heterogeneity in complex, unsynchronized cellular populations. However, many important biological questions demand quantitative analysis of large numbers of individual cells. Hence, new tools are urgently needed for efficient, inexpensive, and parallel manipulation of RNA from individual cells. We report a simple microfluidic platform for trapping single cell lysates in sealed, picoliter microwells capable of “printing” RNA on glass or capturing RNA on polymer beads. To demonstrate the utility of our system for single cell transcriptomics, we developed a highly scalable technology for genome-wide, single cell RNA-Seq. The current implementation of our device is pipette-operated, profiles hundreds of individual cells in parallel with library preparation costs of ~$0.10-$0.20/cell, and includes five lanes for simultaneous experiments. We anticipate that this system will ultimately serve as a general platform for large-scale single cell transcriptomics, compatible with both imaging and sequencing readouts.!Series_type = Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing

Title: Single-cell RNA-seq of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells reveals unique profiles of lineage priming 
Summary: The plasticity and immunomodulatory capacity of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have spurred clinical use in recent years. However, clinical outcomes vary and many ascribe inconsistency to the tissue source of MSCs. Yet unconsidered is the extent of heterogeneity of individual MSCs from a given tissue source with respect to differentiation potential and immune regulatory function. Here we use single-cell RNA-seq to assess the transcriptional diversity of murine mesenchymal stem cells derived from bone marrow. We found genes associated with MSC multipotency were expressed at a high level and with consistency between individual cells. However, genes associated with osteogenic, chondrogenic, adipogenic, neurogenic and vascular smooth muscle differentiation were expressed at widely varying levels between individual cells. Further, certain genes associated with immunomodulation were also inconsistent between individual cells. Differences could not be ascribed to cycles of proliferation, culture bias or other cellular process, which might alter transcript expression in a regular or cyclic pattern. These results support and extend the concept of lineage priming of MSCs and emphasize caution for in vivo or clinical use of MSCs, even when immunomodulation is the goal, since multiple mesodermal (and even perhaps ectodermal) outcomes are a possibility. Purification might enable shifting of the probability of a certain outcome, but is unlikely to remove multilineage potential altogether.

Title: Single-cell chromatin accessibility data using scATAC-seq 
Summary: A single hematopoietic stem cell can give rise to all blood cells with remarkable fidelity. Here, we define the chromatin accessibility and transcriptional landscape controlling this process in thirteen primary cell types that traverse the hematopoietic hierarchy. Exploiting the finding that enhancer landscapes better reflect cell identity than mRNA levels, we enable "enhancer cytometry" for accurate enumeration of pure cell types from complex populations. We further reveal the lineage ontogeny of genetic elements linked to diverse human diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia, chromatin accessibility reveals distinctive regulatory evolution in pre-leukemic HSCs (pHSCs), leukemia stem cells, and leukemic blasts. These leukemic cells demonstrate unique lineage infidelity, confirmed by single cell regulomes. We further show that pHSCs have a competitive advantage that is conferred by reduced chromatin accessibility at HOXA9 targets and is associated with adverse patient outcomes. Thus, regulome dynamics can provide diverse insights into human hematopoietic development and disease.

Title: An RNA-Seq transcriptome and splicing database of neurons, glia, and vascular cells of the cerebral cortex 
Summary: Purpose: To better understand the function of the various cell types of the brain, we prospectively purified neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells, newly formed oligodendrocytes, myelinating oligodendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and pericytes from mouse cerebral cortex. We generated a transcriptome database for these 8 cell types by RNA sequencing and used a highly sensitive algorithm to detect alternative splicing events in each gene. Our analysis identified thousands of new cell type enriched genes and splicing isoforms that will provide novel markers for cell identification, new tools for genetic manipulation, and numerous insights into the biology of the brain. Method Part1:To purify astrocytes, we took advantage of a BAC transgenic mouse line expressing EGFP under the control of regulatory sequences in Aldh1l1-BAC. This line has been previously characterized to have complete astrocyte-specific labeling throughout the brain. Cells from a litter of 8-16 P7 Aldh1l1-EGFP transgenic mice of both genders were pooled together as one biological replicate. The cortices were dissected out and meninges were removed. The tissue was enzymatically dissociated to make a suspension of single cells as described previously. Briefly, the tissue was incubated at 33 °C for 45 minutes in 20 ml of a papain solution containing Earle’s balanced salts (EBSS, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, E7510), D(+)-glucose (22.5mM), NaHCO3 (26mM), DNase (125U/ml, Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, LS002007), papain (9 U/ml, Worthington, Lakewood, NJ, LS03126), and L-cysteine (1mM, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, C7880). The papain solution was equilibrated with 5% CO2 and 95% O2 gas before and during papain treatment. Following papain treatment, the tissue was washed three times with 4.5ml of inhibitor buffer containing BSA (1.0mg/ml, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, A-8806), and ovomucoid (also known as trypsin inhibitor, 1.0 mg/ml, Roche Diagnostics Corporation, Indianapolis, IN 109878) and then mechanically dissociated by gentle sequential trituration using a 5ml pipette. Dissociated cells were layered on top of 10ml of high concentration inhibitor solution with 5mg/ml BSA and 5mg/ml ovomucoid and centrifuged at 130g for 5 minutes. The cell pellet was then resuspended in 12 ml Dulbecco’s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS, Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA 14287) containing 0.02% BSA and 12.5U/ml DNase and filtered through a 20um Nitex mesh (Sefar America Inc., Depew NY, Lab Pak 03-20/14) to remove undissociated cell clumps. This yields a single cell suspension. Cell health is assessed by trypan blue exclusion. Only single cell suspensions with >85% viability were used for purification experiments. 1μg/ml propidium iodide (PI, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, P4864) was added to the single cell solution to label dead cells. Cells were sorted on a BD Aria II cell sorter (BD Bioscience) with a 70μm nozzle. Dead cells and debris were gated first by their low forward light scatter and high side light scatter and secondly by high PI staining. Doublets were removed by high side light scatter. Cell concentration and flow rate were carefully adjusted to maximize purity. Astrocytes were identified based on high EGFP fluorescence. FACS routinely yielded >99% purity based on reanalysis of sorted cells. Method Part2:To purify neurons, a single cell suspension was prepared as described above and incubated at 34 °C for one hour to allow expression of cell surface protein antigens digested by papain, and then incubated on two sequential panning plates coated with BSL-1 to deplete endothelial cells (10 minutes each), followed by a 30 minute incuation on a plate coated with mouse IgM anti-O4 hybridoma (Bansal et al., 1989. 4ml hybridoma supernatant diluted with 8ml DPBS/0.2% BSA) to deplete OPCs, and then incubated for 20 minutes on a plate coated with rat anti-mouse CD45 (BD Pharmingen 550539, 1.25ug in 12ml of DPBS/0.2% BSA) to deplete microglia and macrophages. Finally cells were added to a plate coated with rat anti-mouse L1CAM (30ug in 12ml of DPBS/0.2% BSA, Millipore, Billerica, MA, MAB5272) to bind neurons. The adherent cells on the L1CAM plate were washed 8 times with 10-20 ml of DPBS to remove all antigen-negative nonadherent cells, and then removed from the plate by treating with trypsin (Sigma, 1,000U/ml, T-4665) in 8ml Ca2+ and Mg2+ free EBSS (Irvine Scientific, Santa Ana, CA, 9208) for 3-10 minutes at 37°C in a 10% CO2 incubator. The trypsin was then neutralized with 20ml of fetal calf serum (FCS) solution containing 30% FCS (Gibco, 10437-028), 35% Dulbecco’s modified eagle medium (DMEM, Invitrogen, 11960-044), and 35% Neurobasal (Gibco, 21103-049). The cells were dislodged by gentle squirting of FCS solution over the plate and harvested by centrifugation at 200g for 10 minutes. Method Part3:To purify microglia and oligodendrocyte-lineage cells, the mice were first perfused with 10ml PBS to remove macrophage contamination from the brain. A single cell suspension was then prepared as described above and incubated 20 minutes on a plate coated with rat anti-mouse CD45 (BD Pharmingen 550539, 1.25ug in 12ml of DPBS/0.2% BSA) to harvest microglia, and then incubated sequentially on four BSL1 coated plates (8 minutes each) to deplete endothelial cells and remaining microglia. The remaining cells were next incubated for 30 minutes on a rat anti-PDGFRα (10ug in 12ml DPBS/0.2% BSA, Fitzgerald, Acton, MA, 10R-CD140aMS) coated plate to harvest OPCs, and then incubated on an additional PDGFRα plate and mouse A2B5 monoclonal antibody ascites (American Type Culture Collection, Rockville, MD) coated plate for 30 minutes each to deplete remaining OPCs. The cell suspension was next incubated on an anti-MOG hybridoma coated plate for 30 minutes to harvest myelinating oligodendrocytes, followed by an additional anti-MOG hybridoma coated plate for 30 minutes to deplete any remaining myelinating oligodendrocytes. Finally, the cell suspension was incubated on an anti-GalC hybridoma coated plate for 30 minutes to harvest newly formed oligodendrocytes. For purification of RNA, the cells were lysed while still attached to the panning plate with Qiazol reagent (Qiagen 217004), and total RNA was purified as described below. Mehtod Part4:To purify endothelial cells, we took advantage of Tie2-EGFP transgenic mice available from Jackson labs. These mice express EGFP under the pan-endothelial Tie2 promotor (Daneman et al., 2010; Motoike et al., 2000). Single cell suspension was prepared and FACS was performed as described above. Method Part5: RNA-Seq was performed on the polyadenylated fraction of RNA isolated from purified cell samples.Two biological replicates were used for each phase.100 ng total RNAs were used for each sequencing library. RNA samples were polyA selected and paired-end sequencing libraries were constructed using TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit as described in the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation V2 Guide (Illumina).The samples were then sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer. Method Part6: Read mapping and Transcriptome construction were done by using optimized pipeline which integrate Tophat followed by Cufflinks. Result:We purified neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), newly formed oligodendrocytes (NFOs), myelinating oligodendrocytes (MOs), microglia, endothelial cells and pericytes from mouse cortex and used RNA-Seq to generate a high resolution transcriptome database of > 22,000 genes. We identified thousands of novel cell type-enriched genes that have not been previously identified. These include novel transcription factors, ligands, receptors, enzymes, and signaling molecules. We then used a novel splice mapping algorithm to identify thousands of cell type-specific alternative splicing events. Conclusion:We generated a transcriptome database for these 8 cell types by RNA sequencing and used a highly sensitive algorithm to detect alternative splicing events in each gene. Our analysis i

Title: Histone modifications define expression bias of homoeologous genomes in allotetraploid cotton 
Summary: Histone modifications regulate gene expression in eukaryotes, but their roles in gene expression changes in interspecific hybrids or allotetraploids are poorly understood. Histone modifications can be mapped by immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes at the single cell level and/or by chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) for individual genes. Here we examined H3K4me3 density and transcriptome maps in root-tip cells of allotetraploid cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.). The overall H3K4me3 levels were relatively equal between A and D chromosomes, which were consistent with equal numbers of expressed genes between the two subgenomes. However, intensities per chromosomal area were nearly twice as high in the D homoeologs as in the A homoeologs. Consistent with the cytological observation, ChIP-seq analysis showed more D-homoeologs with biased H3K4me3 levels than A-homoeologs with biased modifications, which correlated with the greater number of genes with D-biased expression than that with A-biased expression in most homoeologous chromosome pairs. Two chromosomes displayed different expression levels compared with other chromosomes probably because of translocations, which may affect the local chromatin structure (hence expression levels) for the genes involved. This example of genome-wide histone modifications that determine expression bias of homoeologous genes in allopolyploids provides a molecular basis for the evolution and domestication of polyploid species including important crops.

Title: Pooled CRISPR screening with single-cell transcriptome read-out 
Summary: We combined CRISPR genome editing with single-cell RNA sequencing to assess complex phenotypes in pooled cellular screens. Our method for CRISPR droplet sequencing (CROP-seq) comprises four key components: a gRNA vector that makes individual gRNAs detectable in single-cell transcriptomes, a high-throughput assay for single-cell RNA-seq, a computational pipeline for assigning single-cell transcriptomes to gRNAs, and a bioinformatic method for analyzing and interpreting gRNA-induced transcriptional profiles. CROP-seq allowed us to link gRNA expression to the associated transcriptome responses in thousands of single cells using a straightforward and broadly applicable screening workflow.

Title: Single-cell RNA-Seq resolves cellular complexity in sensory organs from the neonatal inner ear 
Summary: In the inner ear, cochlear and vestibular sensory epithelia utilize grossly similar cell types to transduce different stimuli: sound and acceleration.  Each individual sensory epithelium is composed of highly heterogeneous populations of cells based on physiological and anatomical criteria. However, limited numbers of each cell type have impeded transcriptional characterization. Here we generated transcriptomes for 301 single cells from the utricular and cochlear sensory epithelia of newborn mice to circumvent this challenge. Cluster analysis indicates distinct profiles for each of the major sensory epithelial cell types, as well as less distinct subpopulations. Asynchrony within utricles allows reconstruction of the temporal progression of cell-type specific differentiation and suggests possible plasticity among cells at the sensory-nonsensory boundary. Comparisons of cell types from utricles and cochleae demonstrate divergence between auditory and vestibular cells despite a common origin. These results provide significant insights into the developmental processes that form unique inner ear cell types.

Title: Genetic Programs in Human and Mouse Early Embryos Revealed by Single-Cell RNA-Sequencing 
Summary: Mammalian preimplantation development is a complex process involving dramatic changes in the transcriptional architecture. Through single-cell RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), we report here a comprehensive analysis of transcriptome dynamics from oocyte to morula in both human and mouse embryos. Based on single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in blastomere mRNAs and paternal-specific SNPs, we identify novel stage-specific monoallelic expression patterns for a significant portion of polymorphic gene transcripts (25-53%). By weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), we find that each developmental stage can be concisely delineated by a small number of functional modules of co-expressed genes. This result indicates a sequential order of transcriptional changes in pathways of cell cycle, gene regulation, translation, and metabolism in a step-wise fashion from cleavage to morula. Cross-species comparisons reveal that the majority of human stage-specific modules (7 out of 9) are remarkably preserved, only to diverge in developmental specificity and timing in mice. We further identify conserved key members (or hub genes) of the human and mouse networks. These genes represent novel candidates that are likely key players in driving mammalian preimplantation development. Collectively, we demonstrate that mammalian preimplantation development is orchestrated by evolutionarily conserved genetic programs that diverge in developmental timing. Our results provide a valuable resource to dissect gene regulatory mechanism underlying progressive development of early mammalian embryos.

Title: Single-cell RNA-seq reveals disparate macrophage responses to intracellular Salmonella 
Summary: Intracellular bacterial pathogens can exhibit large heterogeneity in growth rate inside host cells with major consequences for the infection outcome. If and how the host responds to this heterogeneity remains poorly understood. Here, we combined a fluorescent reporter of bacterial cell division with single-cell RNA-seq analysis to study the macrophage response to different intracellular states of the model pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. The transcriptomes of individual infected macrophages revealed a spectrum of functional host response states to dividing and non-dividing bacteria. Intriguingly, macrophages harboring non-dividing Salmonella display hallmarks of the pro-inflammatory M1 polarization state and differ little from bystander cells, suggesting that non-dividing bacteria evade recognition by intracellular immune receptors. By contrast, macrophages containing dividing bacteria have turned into an anti-inflammatory, M2-like state, as if fast-growing intracellular Salmonella overcome host defense by reprogramming macrophage polarization. Additionally, our clustering approach reveals intermediate host functional states between these extremes. Altogether our data suggest that gene expression variability in infected host cells shapes different cellular environments, some of which may favor a growth arrest of Salmonella facilitating immune evasion and the establishment of a long-term niche; while others allow Salmonella to escape intracellular antimicrobial activity and proliferate.

Title: High-Throughput Single-Cell Labeling (Hi-SCL) for RNA-Seq using drop-based microfluidics 
Summary: The importance of single-cell level data is increasingly appreciated, and significant advances in this direction have been made in recent years. Common to these technologies is the need to physically segregate individual cells into containers, such as wells or chambers of a micro-fluidics chip. High-throughput Single-Cell Labeling (Hi-SCL) in drops is a novel method that uses drop-based libraries of oligonucleotide barcodes to index individual cells in a population. The use of drops as containers, and a microfluidics platform to manipulate them en-masse, yields a highly scalable methodological framework. Once tagged, labeled molecules from different cells may be mixed without losing the cell-of-origin information. Here we demonstrate an application of the method for generating RNA-sequencing data for multiple individual cells within a population. Barcoded oligonucleotides are used to prime cDNA synthesis within drops. Barcoded cDNAs are then combined and subjected to second generation sequencing. The data are deconvoluted based on the barcodes, yielding single-cell mRNA expression data. In a proof-of-concept set of experiments we show that this method yields data comparable to other existing methods, but with unique potential for assaying very large numbers of cells.

Title: Human cerebral organoids recapitulate gene expression programs of fetal neocortex development. 
Summary: Cerebral organoids – three-dimensional cultures of human cerebral tissue derived from pluripotent stem cells – have emerged as models of human cortical development. However, the extent to which in vitro organoid systems recapitulate neural progenitor cell proliferation and neuronal differentiation programs observed in vivo remains unclear. Here we use single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to dissect and compare cell composition and progenitor-to-neuron lineage relationships in human cerebral organoids and fetal neocortex. Covariation network analysis using the fetal neocortex data reveals known and novel interactions among genes central to neural progenitor proliferation and neuronal differentiation. In the organoid, we detect diverse progenitors and differentiated cell types of neuronal and mesenchymal lineages, and identify cells that derived from regions resembling the fetal neocortex. We find that these organoid cortical cells use gene expression programs remarkably similar to those of the fetal tissue in order to organize into cerebral cortex-like regions. Our comparison of in vivo and in vitro cortical single cell transcriptomes illuminates the genetic features underlying human cortical development that can be studied in organoid cultures.

Title: Single cell transcriptomics analysis of induced pluripotent stem cell-derived cortical neurons reveals frequent dual layer identity 
Summary: Induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived cortical neurons present a powerful new model of neurological disease. Previous work has established that differentiation protocols produce cortical neurons but little has been done to characterise these at cellular resolution. In particular, it is unclear to what extent in vitro two-dimensional, relatively disordered culture conditions recapitulate the development of in vivo cortical layer identity. Single cell multiplex RT-qPCR was used to interrogate the expression of genes previously implicated in cortical layer or phenotypic identity in individual cells. Unexpectedly, 22.7% of neurons analysed frequently co-expressed canonical fetal deep and upper cortical layer markers, and this co-expression was also present at the level of translated protein. By comparing our results to available single cell RNA-seq data from human fetal and adult brain, we observed that this co-expression of layer markers was also seen in primary tissue. These results suggest that establishing neuronal layer identity in iPSC-derived or primary cortical neurons using canonical marker genes transcripts is unlikely to be informative.

Title: Deep sequencing reveals cell-type specific patterns of single cell transcriptome variation 
Summary: We present high quality deep read-depth single cell RNA sequencing for 91 cells from five mouse tissues and 18 cells from two rat tissues, along with 30 control samples of bulk RNA diluted to single-cell levels. We find that transcriptomes differ globally across tissues with regard to the number of genes expressed, the average expression patterns, and within cell-type variation patterns. We develop methods to filter genes for reliable quantification and to calibrate biological variation. All cell types include genes with high variability in expression, in a tissue-specific manner. We also find evidence that single cell variability of neuronal genes in mice is correlated with that in rats consistent with the hypothesis that levels of variation may be conserved.

Title: Single Cell RNA-Sequencing Identifies Diverse Roles of Epithelial Cells in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis 
Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal interstitial lung disease causing alveolar remodeling, inflammation, and fibrosis. We utilized single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to identify epithelial cell types and associated biological processes involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. Transcriptomic analysis of epithelial cells from normal human lung defined gene expression patterns associated with highly differentiated alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, indicated by enrichment of RNAs critical for surfactant homeostasis. In contrast, scRNA-seq of IPF cells identified three distinct subsets of epithelial cell types with characteristics of conducting airway basal and goblet cells and, an additional atypical "transitional" cell that contribute to pathological processes in IPF. Individual IPF cells frequently co-expressed alveolar AT1, AT2, and conducting airway selective markers, demonstrating "indeterminate" states of differentiation not seen in normal lung development. Pathway analysis predicted aberrant activation of canonical signaling via TGF-ß, HIPPO/YAP, P53, and AKT-PI3 Kinase. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy identified the disruption of alveolar structure and loss of the normal proximal-peripheral differentiation of pulmonary epithelial cells. Single cell transcriptomic analyses of respiratory epithelial cells identified loss of normal epithelial cell identities and unique contributions of epithelial cells to the pathogenesis of IPF. Present scRNA-seq transcriptomic analysis of normal and IPF respiratory epithelial cells provides a rich data source to further explore lung health and disease.

Title: The landscape of accessible chromatin in mammalian pre-implantation embryos (RNA-Seq) 
Summary: In mammals, extensive chromatin reorganization is essential for reprogramming terminally committed gametes to a totipotent state during preimplantation development. However, the global chromatin landscape and its dynamics in this period remain unexplored. Here we report a genome-wide map of accessible chromatin in mouse preimplantation embryos using an improved assay for transposase-accessible chromatin with high throughput sequencing (ATAC-seq) approach with CRISPR/Cas9-assisted mitochondrial DNA depletion. We show that despite extensive parental asymmetry in DNA methylomes, the chromatin accessibility between the parental genomes is globally comparable after major zygotic genome activation (ZGA). Accessible chromatin in early embryos is widely shaped by transposable elements and overlaps extensively with putative cis-regulatory sequences. Unexpectedly, accessible chromatin is also found near the transcription end sites of active genes. By integrating the maps of cis-regulatory elements and single-cell transcriptomes, we construct the regulatory network of early development, which helps to identify the key modulators for lineage specification. Finally, we find that the activities of cis-regulatory elements and their associated open chromatin diminished before major ZGA. Surprisingly, we observed many loci showing non-canonical, large open chromatin domains over the entire transcribed units in minor ZGA, supporting the presence of an unusually permissive chromatin state. Together, these data reveal a unique spatiotemporal chromatin configuration that accompanies early mammalian development.

Title: Selective single cell isolation for genomics using microraft arrays 
Summary: Genomic methods are used increasingly to interrogate the individual cells that compose specific tissues. However, current methods for single cell isolation struggle to phenotypically differentiate specific cells in a heterogeneous population and rely primarily on the use of fluorescent markers. Many cellular phenotypes of interest are too complex to be measured by this approach, making it difficult to connect genotype and phenotype at the level of individual cells. Here we demonstrate that microraft arrays, which are arrays containing thousands of individual cell culture sites, can be used to select single cells based on a variety of phenotypes, such as cell surface markers, cell proliferation and drug response. We then show that a common genomic procedure, RNA-seq, can be readily adapted to the single cells isolated from these rafts. We show that data generated using microrafts and our modified RNA-seq protocol compared favorably with the Fluidigm C1. We then used microraft arrays to select pancreatic cancer cells that proliferate in spite of cytotoxic drug treatment. Our single cell RNA-seq data identified several expected and novel gene expression changes associated with early drug resistance.

Title: Identification of a Transcription Factor that Promotes Spermatogonial Stem Cell Establishment 
Summary: Spermatogonial stem cells (SSCs) are critical for maintaining spermatogenesis throughout adult life. Little is known about how SSCs are first generated. Here, we report the identification of a transcription factor—RHOX10—that promotes the initial establishment of SSCs. We were led to this discovery because we found that conditional loss of a large X-linked gene cluster comprised of 33 related homeobox genes, including Rhox10, causes defects predicted if SSCs fail to be generated or maintained. Remarkably, KO of only Rhox10 elicits SSC-related defects indistinguishable from KO of the entire gene cluster. Using a battery of approaches, including single cell-RNAseq analysis, we determined that loss of Rhox10 causes accumulation of undifferentiated germ cells—Pro-spermatogonia (ProSG)—at a time when they normally would form SSCs. The identification of a transcription factor that drives the initial generation of SSCs has potential therapeutic applications for infertility.

Title: Unstranded RNA sequencing data 
Summary: A single hematopoietic stem cell can give rise to all blood cells with remarkable fidelity. Here, we define the chromatin accessibility and transcriptional landscape controlling this process in thirteen primary cell types that traverse the hematopoietic hierarchy. Exploiting the finding that enhancer landscapes better reflect cell identity than mRNA levels, we enable "enhancer cytometry" for accurate enumeration of pure cell types from complex populations. We further reveal the lineage ontogeny of genetic elements linked to diverse human diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia, chromatin accessibility reveals distinctive regulatory evolution in pre-leukemic HSCs (pHSCs), leukemia stem cells, and leukemic blasts. These leukemic cells demonstrate unique lineage infidelity, confirmed by single cell regulomes. We further show that pHSCs have a competitive advantage that is conferred by reduced chromatin accessibility at HOXA9 targets and is associated with adverse patient outcomes. Thus, regulome dynamics can provide diverse insights into human hematopoietic development and disease.

Title: The Transcriptome and DNA Methylome Landscapes of Human Primordial Germ Cells 
Summary: Germ cells are vital for transmitting genetic information from one generation to the next and for maintaining the continuation of species. Here, we analyze the transcriptome of human primordial germ cells (PGCs) from the migrating stage to the gonadal stage at single-cell and single-base resolutions. Human PGCs show unique transcription patterns involving the simultaneous expression of both pluripotency genes and germline-specific genes, with a subset of them displaying developmental stage-specific features. Furthermore, we analyze the DNA methylome of human PGCs and find global demethylation of their genomes. Approximately 10-11 weeks after gestation, the PGCs are nearly devoid of any DNA methylation; with only 7.8% and 6.0% of the median methylation levels in male and female PGCs, respectively. Our work paves the way toward deciphering the complex epigenetic reprogramming of the germline with the aim of restoring totipotency in fertilized oocytes.

Summary: We here systematically studied the interaction network of bone marrow cells. To this end, we micro-dissected many small interacting structures (cell doublets, triplets etc.) into single cells, and sequenced their mRNAs, to infer cell identity. After grouping the cells into cell types (based on the single-cell transcriptomes), we identified actual physical interactions that occurred more, or less, than what would be expected by chance. We compared the micro-dissected data to sorted hematopoietic stem cells.

Title: Condensin-Driven Remodeling of X-Chromosome Topology during Dosage Compensation [ChIP-Seq] 
Summary: The three-dimensional (3D) organization of a genome plays a critical role in regulating gene expression, yet little is known about the machinery and mechanisms that determine higher-order chromosome structure or how structure influences gene expression. Here we exploit the X-chromosome-wide process of dosage compensation to dissect these mechanisms. The dosage compensation complex (DCC) of C. elegans, a condensin complex, binds to both X chromosomes of hermaphrodites via sequence-specific recruitment sites (rex sites) to reduce chromosome-wide gene expression by half. Using genome-wide chromosome conformation capture and single-cell FISH to compare chromosome structure in wild-type and DCC-defective embryos (DC mutants), we show that the DCC remodels X chromosomes of hermaphrodites into a spatial conformation distinct from autosomes. The dosage-compensated X chromosomes are composed of Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) that have sharper boundaries and more regular spacing than TADs on autosomes. Most TAD boundaries on X coincide with the highest-affinity rex sites, and these boundaries are lost or diminished in DC mutants, thereby restoring the topology of X to a native conformation resembling that of autosomes. Although most rex sites engage in multiple strong DCC-dependent long-range interactions, the strongest interactions occur between rex sites at the DCC-dependent TAD boundaries. We propose the DCC actively shapes the topology of the entire X chromosome by forming new TAD boundaries and reinforcing pre-existing weak TAD boundaries through interactions between its highest affinity sites. Such changes in higher-order X-chromosome structure then influence gene expression over long distances.

Title: RNA-Seq of single cells from regenerating Arabidopsis root 
Summary: Plant roots can regenerate after complete excision of their tip, including the stem cell niche, but it is not clear what developmental program mediates such repair. Here, we use a combination of lineage tracing, single-cell RNA-seq, and marker analysis to test different models of tissue reassembly. We show that rapid cell-identity transitions lead to the formation of a new stem cell niche from multiple remnant tissues. The transcriptome of regenerating cells prior to stem cell activation resembled that of the embryonic root progenitor, and regeneration defects were more severe in embryonic versus adult root mutants. Furthermore, the signaling domains of the hormones auxin and cytokinin mirrored their embryonic dynamics, and manipulation of both hormones altered the position of new tissues and stem cell niche markers. Our findings suggest that plant organ regeneration resembles the developmental stages of embryonic patterning and is guided by spatial information laid down by complementary hormone domains.

These neurons extend axonal projections and are born amongst other neurons during embryogenesis, but remain unspecialized until target organogenesis occurs postnatally. Target innervation and cell-type specification is coordinated by an intricate acquisition of unique combinations of growth factor receptors and the initiation of expression of concomitant ligands by the nascent erector muscles.

Title: Droplet barcoding for single cell transcriptomics applied to embryonic stem cells 
Summary: Recently, RNA sequencing has achieved single cell resolution, but what is limiting is an effective way to routinely isolate and process large numbers of individual cells for in-depth sequencing, and to do so quantitatively. We have developed a droplet-microfluidic approach for parallel barcoding thousands of individual cells for subsequent RNA profiling by next-generation sequencing. This high-throughput method shows a surprisingly low noise profile and is readily adaptable to other sequencing-based assays. Using this technique, we analyzed mouse embryonic stem cells, revealing in detail the population structure and the heterogeneous onset of differentiation after LIF withdrawal. The reproducibility and low noise of this high-throughput single cell data allowed us to deconstruct cell populations and infer gene expression relationships.

Title: Human germ cell formation in xenotransplants of induced pluripotent stem cells carrying X chromosome aneuploidies 
Summary: Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) offer opportunity for insight into the genetic requirements of the X chromosome for somatic and germline development. Turner syndrome is caused by complete or partial loss of the second sex chromosome; while more than 90% of Turner cases result in spontaneous fetal loss, survivors display an array of somatic and germline clinical characteristics. Here, we derived iPSCs from Turner syndrome and control individuals and examined germ cell development as a function of X chromosome composition. We analyzed gene expression profiles of derived iPSCs and in vitro differentiated cells by single cell qRT-PCR and RNA-seq. We whoed that two X chromosomes are not necessary for reprogramming or pluripotency maintenance. Genes that escape X chromosome inactivation (XCI) between control iPSCs and those with X chromosome aneuploidies revealed minimal expression differences relative to a female hESC line. Moreover, when we induced germ cell differentiation via murine xenotransplantation of iPSC lines into the seminiferous tubules of busulfan-treated mice, we observed that undifferentiated iPSCs, independent of X chromosome composition, when placed within the correct somatic environment, are capable of forming early germ cells in vivo. Results indicate that two intact X chromosomes are not required for germ cell formation; however, clinical data suggest that two sex chromosomes are required for maintenance of human germ cells.

Title: Single-cell profiling of non small cell lung cancer associated B-cells. 
Summary: Background: Immune checkpoint blockade improves survival in a subset of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but robust biomarkers that predict response to PD-1 pathway inhibitors are lacking. Furthermore, our understanding of the diversity of the NSCLC tumor immune microenvironment remains limited. Methods: We performed comprehensive flow-cytometric immunoprofiling on both tumor and immune cells from 51 NSCLCs and integrated this analysis with clinical and histopathologic characteristics, next generation sequencing, mRNA expression, and PD-L1 immunohistochemistry (IHC). Results: Cytometric profiling identified an immunologically “hot” cluster with abundant CD8+ T cells expressing high levels of the PD-1 and TIM-3, and an immunologically “cold” cluster with lower relative abundance of CD8+ T cells and expression of inhibitory markers. The “hot” cluster was highly enriched for expression of genes associated with T cell trafficking and cytotoxic function, and high PD-L1 expression by IHC. There was no correlation between immunophenotype and KRAS or EGFR mutation, or patient smoking history, but we did observe an enrichment of squamous subtype and tumors with higher mutation burden in the “hot” cluster. Additionally, ~20% of cases had high B cell infiltrates with a subset producing IL-10. Conclusions: Our results support the use of immune-based metrics to study response and resistance to immunotherapy in lung cancer.

Title: Single Novel single cell assay reveals progressive lymphoid defect in aging multipotent hematopoietic progenitors cell RNA-seq reveals LMPP clonal dynamics in aging. 
Summary: Declining immune function with age is associated with reduced lymphoid output of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Currently, there is poor understanding of the dynamic changes with age in the heterogeneous multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell compartment, which regulates output of differentiated lymphoid cells. In this study, we observed progressive and specific loss of lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor cells (LMPP/MPP4) as young animals began to age. Single cell RNA-seq revealed a concomitant increase in cycling of these progenitors with loss of a lymphoid priming signature. To interrogate functional multipotency of single cells, we developed a novel, feeder-free in vitro assay to concurrently assess lymphoid and myeloid potential. This assay revealed altered clonal composition of the LMPP/MPP4 compartment with aging, where progenitors with B cell and macrophage-restricted potential are lost while functionally multipotent progenitors are preserved. These results pinpoint an age and cellular compartment to focus further interrogation of the drivers of lymphoid cell loss with aging.

Title: Multilineage communication regulates human liver bud self-organization from pluripotency 
Summary: Conventional 2-D differentiation from pluripotency fails to recapitulate cell interactions occurring during organogenesis. 3-D organoids generate complex organ-like tissues, however it is unclear how heterotypic interactions impact lineage identity. Here we use single-cell RNA-seq to reconstruct hepatocyte-like lineage progression from pluripotency in 2-D culture. We then derive 3-D liver bud (LB) organoids by reconstituting hepatic, stromal, and endothelial interactions, and deconstruct heterogeneity during LB self-organization. We find that LB hepatoblasts differentiate towards hepatocyte fate, and in addition express epithelial migration signatures characteristic of organ budding. We identify hypoxia and inflammation signatures in endothelial and mesenchymal cells, which we suggest induce LB vasculogenesis. We use network analysis to predict autocrine and paracrine signaling in LBs, and show that VEGF crosstalk potentiates endothelial network formation and hepatoblast differentiation. Our molecular dissection reveals inter-lineage communication that is required for self-organization, and illuminates previously inaccessible aspects of human organ development and regeneration.

Title: Tissue homogeneity requires inhibition of unequal gene silencing during development 
Summary: Multicellular organisms can generate and maintain homogenous populations of cells that make up individual tissues. But, cellular processes that can disrupt homogeneity and how organisms overcome such disruption are unknown. We found that ~100-fold differences in expression from a repetitive DNA transgene can occur between intestinal cells in C. elegans. These differences are caused by gene silencing in some cells and are actively suppressed by parental and zygotic factors such as the conserved exonuclease ERI-1. If unsuppressed, silencing can spread between some cells in embryos, but can be repeat-specific and independent of other homologous loci within each cell. Silencing can persist through DNA replication and nuclear divisions, disrupting uniform gene expression in developed animals. Analysis at single-cell resolution suggests that differences between cells arise during early cell divisions upon unequal segregation of an initiator of silencing. Our results suggest that organisms with high repetitive DNA content, which include humans, could employ similar developmental mechanisms to achieve and maintain tissue homogeneity.

Title: Single-muscle-cell transcriptome profiling along the planarian anteroposterior axis 
Summary: How positional information instructs adult tissue maintenance is poorly understood. Planarians undergo whole-body regeneration and tissue turnover, providing a model for adult positional information studies. Genes encoding secreted and transmembrane components of multiple developmental pathways are predominantly expressed in planarian muscle cells. Several of these genes regulate regional identity, consistent with muscle harboring positional information. Here, single-cell RNA-sequencing of 115 muscle cells from distinct anterior-posterior regions identified 44 regionally expressed genes, including multiple Wnt and ndk/FGF receptor-like (ndl/FGFRL) genes. Two distinct FGFRL-Wnt circuits, involving juxtaposed anterior FGFRL and posterior Wnt expression domains, controlled planarian head and trunk patterning. ndl-3 and wntP-2 inhibition expanded the trunk, forming ectopic mouths and secondary pharynges, which independently extended and ingested food. fz5/8-4 inhibition, like that of ndk and wntA, caused posterior brain expansion and ectopic eye formation. Our results suggest that FGFRL-Wnt circuits operate within a body-wide coordinate system to control adult axial positioning.

Title: Serum-based culture conditions provoke gene expression variability in mouse embryonic stem cells as revealed by single cell analysis 
Summary: Variation in gene expression is an important feature of mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs). However, the mechanisms responsible for global gene expression variation in ESCs are not fully understood. We performed single cell mRNA-seq analysis of mouse ESCs and uncovered significant heterogeneity in ESCs cultured in serum. Using novel computational approaches we define highly variable gene clusters; and reveal their distinct epigenetic characteristics. We show that bivalent genes are prone to expression variation. At the same time, we identify an ESC priming pathway that initiates the exit from the naïve ESC state. Finally, we provide evidence that a large proportion of intracellular network variability is due to the extracellular culture environment. Serum free culture reduces cellular heterogeneity and transcriptome variation in ESCs.

Title: Flexible multiplatform RNA profiling at the single cell level applied to enriched cancer initiating cells: RNA-Seq MCF7 and MCF10A single cell data 
Summary: Accurate profiling of RNA expression of single cells is a valuable approach for broadening our understanding of cancer biology and mechanisms of dissemination, but requires the development of reliable methods for their molecular characterization. Here we evaluate a single cell methodology which generates microgram amounts of cDNA suitable for next generation sequencing (RNA-Seq), high throughput RT-qPCR and Affymetrix array analysis. The approach was tested by comparing expression profiles of amplified single MCF7 and MCF10A cells to profiles generated from unamplified RNA. The expression profiles were compared by Affymetrix-U133 arrays, RNA-Seq and high-density qPCR. There were strong cross-platform correlations of >80% and concordance between single cell and unamplified material of >70%. We exemplify the approach through analysis of rare sorted cancer initiating cells (CICs) derived from a NSCLC patient-derived xenograft. Populations of 10 cells from total tumour and two distinct subsets of CIC, putatively involved in primary tumor maintenance or metastasis formation were FACS sorted then directly amplified. CIC expression profiles strongly correlated with published stem-cell and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) signatures. Our results confirm the utility of the amplification system and our methodology to detect and distinguish RNA profiles in rare cell populations that inform on EMT and stem-cell characteristics. This GEO dataset comprises the RNA-Seq data for MCF7 and MCF10A single cell samples.

Title: SC3-seq: a method for highly parallel and quantitative measurement of single-cell gene expression. 
Summary: Single-cell mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) methods have undergone rapid development in recent years, and transcriptome analysis of relevant cell populations at single-cell resolution has become a key research area of biomedical sciences. We here present single-cell mRNA 3-prime end sequencing (SC3-seq), a practical methodology based on PCR amplification followed by 3-prime-end enrichment for highly quantitative, parallel and cost-effective measurement of gene expression in single cells. The SC3-seq allows excellent quantitative measurement of mRNAs ranging from the 10,000-cell to 1-cell level, and accordingly, allows an accurate estimate of the transcript levels by a regression of the read counts of spike-in RNAs with defined copy numbers. The SC3-seq has clear advantages over other typical single-cell RNA-seq methodologies for the quantitative measurement of transcript levels and at a sequence depth required for the saturation of transcript detection. The SC3-seq distinguishes four distinct cell types in the peri-implantation mouse blastocysts. Furthermore, the SC3-seq reveals the heterogeneity in human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) cultured under on-feeder as well as feeder-free conditions, demonstrating a more homogeneous property of the feeder-free hiPSCs. We propose that SC3-seq might be used as a powerful strategy for single-cell transcriptome analysis in a broad range of investigations in biomedical sciences.

Title: Genome wide expression analysis of BET inhibitor resistance [RNA-seq] 
Summary: Bromodomain and Extra Terminal protein (BET) inhibitors are first-in-class targeted therapies that deliver a new therapeutic paradigm by directly targeting epigenetic readers1,2. Early clinical trials have shown significant promise especially in acute myeloid leukaemia (AML)3; therefore the evaluation of resistance mechanisms, an inevitable consequence of cancer therapies, is of utmost importance to optimise the clinical efficacy of these drugs. Using primary murine stem and progenitor cells immortalised with MLL-AF9, we have used an innovative approach to generate 20 cell lines derived from single cell clones demonstrating stable resistance, in vitro and in vivo, to the prototypical BET inhibitor, I-BET. Resistance to I-BET confers cross-resistance to chemically distinct BET inhibitors such as JQ1, as well as resistance to genetic knockdown of BET proteins. Resistance is not mediated through increased drug efflux or metabolism but is demonstrated to emerge from leukaemia stem cells (LSC). Resistant clones display a leukaemic granulocyte-macrophage progenitor (L-GMP) phenotype (Lin-, Sca-, cKit+, CD34+, Fc³RII/RIII+) and functionally exhibit increased clonogenic capacity in vitro and markedly shorter leukaemia latency in vivo. Chromatin bound BRD4 is globally reduced in resistant cells, however expression of key target genes such as MYC remains unaltered, highlighting the existence of alternative mechanisms to regulate transcription. We demonstrate that resistance to BET inhibitors is in part a consequence of increased Wnt/²-catenin signaling. Negative regulation of this pathway results in differentiation of resistant cells into mature leukaemic blasts, inhibition of MYC expression and restoration of sensitivity to I-BET in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we show that the sensitivity of primary human AML cells to I-BET correlates with the baseline expression of Wnt/²-catenin target genes. Together these findings provide novel insights into the biology of AML, highlight the potential therapeutic limitations of BET inhibitors and identify strategies that may overcome resistance and enhance the clinical utility of these unique targeted therapies.

Title: Characterization of the single-cell transcriptional landscape by highly multiplex RNA-Seq 
Summary: Our understanding of the development and maintenance of tissues has been greatly aided by large-scale gene expression analysis. However, tissues are invariably complex, and expression analysis of a tissue confounds the true expression patterns of its constitutent cell types. Here we propose a novel strategy to access such complex samples. Hundreds of single-cell RNA-Seq expression profiles were generated, and clustered to form a two-dimensional cell map onto which expression data was projected. The resulting cell map integrates three levels of organization: the whole population of cells, the functionally distinct subpopulations it contains, and the single cells themselves—all without need for known markers to classify cell types. The feasibility of the strategy is demonstrated by analyzing the complete transcriptomes of 436 single cells of three distinct types. We believe this strategy will enable the unbiased discovery and analysis of naturally occurring cell types during development, adult physiology and disease.

Title: Identification of rare, dormant and therapy resistant stem cells in acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
Summary: Tumor relapse is associated with dismal prognosis, but responsible biological principles remain incompletely understood. To isolate and characterize relapse-inducing cells, we used genetic engineering and proliferation-sensitive dyes in patient-derived xenografts of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). We identified a rare subpopulation that resembled relapse-inducing cells with combined properties of long-term dormancy, treatment resistance, and stemness. Single-cell and bulk expression profiling revealed their similarity to primary ALL cells isolated from pediatric and adult patients at minimal residual disease (MRD). Therapeutically adverse characteristics were reversible, as resistant, dormant cells became sensitive to treatment and started proliferating when dissociated from the in vivo environment. Our data suggest that ALL patients might profit from therapeutic strategies that release MRD cells from the niche.

Title: Single-Cell RNAseq Reveals That Pancreatic β-Cells From Very Old Male Mice Have a Young Gene Signature 
Summary: Aging improves pancreatic β-cell function in mice. This is a surprising finding since aging is typically associated with functional decline. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing of β-cells from 3 and 26 month old mice to explore how changes in gene expression contribute to improved function with age. The old mice were healthy, had reduced blood glucose levels and increased β-cell mass, which correlated to their body weight. β-cells from young and old mice had similar transcriptome profiles. In fact, only 193 genes (0.89% of all detected genes) were significantly regulated (≥ 2-fold; false discovery rate < 0.01; normalized counts > 5). Of these, 183 were downregulated and mainly associated with pathways regulating gene expression, cell cycle, cell death and survival as well as cellular movement, function and maintenance. Collectively, our data show that β-cells from very old mice have transcriptome profiles similar to those of young mice. These data support previous findings that aging is not associated with reduced β-cell mass or functional β-cell decline in mice.

Title: Single-cell RNA-seq reveals activation of unique gene groups as a consequence of stem cell-parenchymal cell fusion 
Summary: Fusion of donor mesenchymal stem cells with parenchymal cells of the recipient can occur in the brain, liver, intestine and heart following transplantation. The therapeutic benefit or detriment of resultant hybrids is unknown. Here we sought a global view of phenotypic diversification of mesenchymal stem cell-cardiomyocyte hybrids and associated time course. Using single-cell RNA-seq, we found hybrids consistently increase ribosome components and decrease genes associated with the cell cycle suggesting an increase in protein production and decrease in proliferation to accommodate the fused state. But in the case of most other gene groups, hybrids were individually distinct. In fact, though hybrids can express a transcriptome similar to individual fusion partners, approximately one-third acquired distinct expression profiles in a single day. Some hybrids underwent reprogramming, expressing pluripotency and cardiac precursor genes latent in parental cells and associated with developmental and morphogenic gene groups. Other hybrids expressed genes associated with ontologic cancer sets and two hybrids of separate experimental replicates clustered with breast cancer cells, expressing critical oncogenes and lacking tumor suppressor genes. Rapid transcriptional diversification of this type garners consideration in the context of cellular transplantation to damaged tissues, those with viral infection or other microenvironmental conditions that might promote fusion.

Title: Circulating Tumor Cell Clusters are Oligoclonal Precursors of Breast Cancer Metastasis 
Summary: Clusters of circulating tumor cells (CTC-clusters) are present in the blood of patients with cancer but their contribution to metastasis is not well defined. Here, we first use mouse models to demonstrate that breast cancer cells injected intravascularly as clusters are more prone to survive and colonize the lungs than single cells. Primary mammary tumors comprised of tagged cells give rise to oligoclonal CTC-clusters, with 50-fold increased metastatic potential, compared with single CTCs. Using intravital imaging and in vivo flow cytometry, CTC-clusters are visualized in the tumor circulation, and they demonstrate rapid clearance in peripheral vessels. In patients with breast cancer, presence of CTC-clusters is correlated with decreased progression-free survival. RNA sequencing identifies the cell junction protein plakoglobin as most differentially expressed between clusters and single human breast CTCs. Expression of plakoglobin is required for efficient CTC-cluster formation and breast cancer metastasis in mice, while its expression is associated with diminished metastasis-free survival in breast cancer patients. Together, these observations suggest that plakoglobin-enriched primary tumor cells break off into the vasculature as CTC-clusters, with greatly enhanced metastasis propensity.

We also compare with Smart-Seq to demonstrate CEL-Seq2’s increased sensitivity relative to other available methods. Collectively, the improvements make CEL-Seq2 uniquely suited to single-cell RNA-Seq analysis in terms of economics, resolution, and ease of use

Title: Spatially resolved, highly multiplexed RNA profiling in single cells 
Summary: Knowledge of the expression profile and spatial landscape of the transcriptome in individual cells is essential for understanding the rich repertoire of cellular behaviors. Here we report multiplexed error-robust fluorescence in situ hybridization (MERFISH), a single-molecule imaging approach that allows the copy numbers and spatial localizations of thousands of RNA species to be determined in single cells. Using error-robust encoding schemes to combat single-molecule labeling and detection errors, we demonstrated the imaging of 100 – 1000 unique RNA species in hundreds of individual cells. Correlation analysis of the ~10^4 – 10^6 pairs of genes allowed us to constrain gene regulatory networks, predict novel functions for many unannotated genes, and identify distinct spatial distribution patterns of RNAs that correlate with properties of the encoded proteins.

Title: Dissecting the clonal nature of allelic expression in somatic cells by single-cell RNA-seq 
Summary: Cellular heterogeneity can emerge from the expression of only one parental allele, however it has remained unknown to what degree patterns of random monoallelic expression of autosomal genes (aRME) are mitotically inherited (clonal) or stochastic (dynamic) in somatic cells. Here, we resolved this by applying allele-sensitive single-cell RNA-seq on primary mouse fibroblasts and in vivo human T-cells to simultaneously investigate clonal and dynamic aRME. Dynamic aRME affected a considerable portion of the transcriptome, with levels dependent on the cell’s transcriptional activity, but clonal aRME was surprisingly scarce (<1% of genes) and affected mainly lowly expressed genes. Consequently, the overwhelming portion of aRME occurs transiently and is scattered throughout somatic populations rather than, as previously hypothesized, confined to spatially restricted patches of clonally related cells.

Title: RNA-Seq of single cells from the Arabidopsis root 
Summary: The definition of cell identity is a central problem in biology. Single-cell RNA-seq provides a wealth of information regarding the developmental state of individual cells. However, better methods are needed to map the identity of single cells, especially during identity transitions. We have developed a quantitative classification method that is robust to expression noise and can detect primary and chimeric identities from single-cell RNA sequencing profiles. The method uses existing transcriptome repositories of grouped cell-types to define a set of optimal cell-identity markers, which are then used to define a cell identity metric. This metric accurately classified diverse cell identities in Arabidopsis root tips and human glioblastoma cells. We demonstrate the strength of the approach to resolve a dynamic developmental process by analyzing the identity of single cells captured from regenerating Arabidopsis roots following removal of their stem-cell-niche. We discover that, apart from new niche formation at the vicinity of the cut site, cells that are distant from the injury site also undergo a transient, partial collapse of identity during the regeneration and reorganization of the root, demonstrating the usefulness of a quantitative cell identity metric.

Title: Functional Inflammatory Profiles Distinguish Myelin-Reactive T Cells from Patients with Multiple Sclerosis 
Summary: Myelin-reactive T cells have been identified in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and healthy subjects with comparable frequencies, but the contribution of these autoreactive T cells to disease pathology remains unknown. A total of 13,324 T cell libraries generated from blood of 23 patients and 22 healthy controls were interrogated for reactivity to myelin antigens. Libraries derived from CCR6+ myelin-reactive T cells from patients with MS exhibited significantly enhanced production of IFN-γ, IL-17, and GM-CSF compared to healthy controls. Single-cell clones isolated by MHC/peptide tetramers from CCR6+ T cell libraries also secreted more pro-inflammatory cytokines while clones isolated from controls secreted more IL-10. The transcriptomes of myelin-specific CCR6+ T cells from patients with MS were distinct from those derived from healthy controls, and of note, were enriched in Th17-induced experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE) gene signatures and gene signatures derived from Th17 cells isolated other human autoimmune diseases. These data, although not casual, imply that functional differences between antigen specific T cells from MS and healthy controls is fundamental to disease development and support the notion that IL-10 production from myelin-reactive T cells may act to limit disease progression, or even pathogenesis.

We find that the data from single-nucleus RNA-seq is consistent with the transcriptome from single-cell RNA-seq. The pri-mRNA expression characterized by single-nucleus RNA-seq can reflect the actual miRNA level in the whole cell.

Title: Subcellular RNA Sequencing Reveals Broad Presence of Cytoplasmic Intron-sequence Retaining Transcripts in Mouse and Rat Neurons. 
Summary: Recent findings have revealed the complexity of the transcriptional landscape in mammalian cells. One recently described class of novel transcripts are the Cytoplasmic Intron-sequence Retaining Transcripts (CIRTs), hypothesized to confer post-transcriptional regulatory function. For instance, the neuronal CIRT KCNMA1i16 contributes to the firing properties of hippocampal neurons. We hypothesized that CIRTs may be present in a broad set of transcripts and comprise novel signals for post-transcriptional regulation. We carried out a transcriptome-wide survey of CIRTs by sequencing micro-dissected subcellular RNA fractions. Two batches of 150-300 individually dissected dendrites from primary cultures of hippocampal neurons in rat and three batches from mouse hippocampal neurons were sequenced. After statistical processing to minimize artifacts, we found a broad prevalence of CIRTs in the neurons in both species (44-60% of the expressed transcripts). The analysis for CIRTs was also carried out by sequencing single cells from mouse brown adipose tissue and mouse cardiomyocytes. There was widespread prevalence of CIRTs in all of the cell types.

Title: High throughput quantitative whole transcriptome analysis of distal mouse lung epithelial cells from various developmental stages (E14.5, E16.5, E18.5 and adult) 
Summary: We used microfluidic single cell RNA-seq on 198 individual mouse lung epithelial cells at 4 different stages throughout development to measure the transcriptional states which define the developmental and cellular hierarchy of the distal mouse lung epithelium. We classified 80 cells comprising the distal lung epithelium at E18.5 into distinct populations using an unbiased genome-wide approach that did not require a priori knowledge of the underlying cell types or prior purification of cell types. This “reverse tissue engineering” approach confirmed the basic outlines of the conventional model of cell type diversity in the distal lung and led to the discovery of a large number of novel transcriptional regulators and cell type markers that discriminate between the different populations. Moreover, we reconstructed the steps during maturation of bipotential progenitors into both alveolar lineages based on the presence of undifferentiated, differentiated as well as differentiation intermediate cells at the single time point E18.5. Finally, we followed Sftpc-positive cells throughout their lifecycle (E14.5, E16.5, E18.5, adult) and identified 7 gene sets that differentiate between the multipotential, bipotential, mature, as well as intermediate states of the AT2 lineage.

Title: Use of the Fluidigm C1 platform for RNA sequencing of single mouse pancreatic islet cells 
Summary: This study provides an assessment of the Fluidigm C1 platform for RNA sequencing of single mouse pancreatic islet cells. The system combines microfluidic technology and nanoliter-scale reactions. We sequenced 622 cells allowing identification of 341 islet cells with high-quality gene expression profiles. The cells clustered into populations of alpha-cells (5%), beta-cells (92%), delta-cells (1%) and PP-cells (2%). We identified cell-type specific transcription factors and pathways primarily involved in nutrient sensing and oxidation and cell signaling. Unexpectedly, 281 cells had to be removed from the analysis due to low viability (23%), low sequencing quality (13%) or contamination resulting in the detection of more than one islet hormone (64%). Collectively, we provide a resource for identification of high-quality gene expression datasets to help expand insights into genes and pathways characterizing islet cell types. We reveal limitations in the C1 Fluidigm cell capture process resulting in contaminated cells with altered gene expression patterns. This calls for caution when interpreting single-cell transcriptomics data using the C1 Fluidigm system.

Title: Genetic Diversity Through RNA Editing: Apobec1-mediated RNA editing in bulk and single cell macrophages and dendritic cells 
Summary: RNA editing is a mutational mechanism that specifically alters the nucleotide content in sets of transcripts while leaving their cognate genomic blueprint intact. Editing has been detected from bulk RNA-seq data in thousands of distinct transcripts, but apparent editing rates can vary widely (from under 1% to almost 100%). These observed editing rates could result from approximately equal rates of editing within each individual cell in the bulk sample, or alternatively, editing estimates from a population of cells could reflect an average of distinct, biologically significant editing signatures that vary substantially between individual cells in the population. To distinguish between these two possibilities we have constructed a hierarchical Bayesian model which quantifies the variance of editing rates at specific sites using RNA-seq data from both single cells and a cognate bulk sample consisting of ∼ 106 cells. The model was applied to data from murine bone-marrow derived macrophages and dendritic cells, and predicted high variance for specific edited sites in both cell types tested. We then 1 validated these predictions using targeted amplification of specific editable transcripts from individual macrophages. Our data demonstrate substantial variance in editing signatures between single cells, supporting the notion that RNA editing generates diversity within cellular populations. Such editing-mediated RNA-level sequence diversity could contribute to the functional heterogeneity apparent in cells of the innate immune system.

Title: Spatial reconstruction of single-cell gene expression 
Summary: Spatial localization is a key determinant of cellular fate and behavior, but spatial RNA assays traditionally rely on staining for a limited number of RNA species. In contrast, single-cell RNA-seq allows for deep profiling of cellular gene expression, but established methods separate cells from their native spatial context. Here we present Seurat, a computational strategy to infer cellular localization by integrating single-cell RNA-seq data with in situ RNA patterns. We applied Seurat to spatially map 851 single cells from dissociated zebrafish (Danio rerio) embryos, inferring a transcriptome-wide map of spatial patterning. We confirmed Seurat’s accuracy using several experimental approaches, and used it to identify a set of archetypal expression patterns and spatial markers. Additionally, Seurat correctly localizes rare subpopulations, accurately mapping both spatially restricted and scattered groups. Seurat will be applicable to mapping cellular localization within complex patterned tissues in diverse systems.

Title: Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals non-canonical brain macrophage activation states in murine neurotrauma 
Summary: Background: Macrophage polarization programs, commonly referred to as “classical” and “alternative” activation, are widely considered as distinct states that are exclusive of one another, and are associated with different functions such as inflammation and wound healing, respectively. In a number of disease contexts, such as traumatic brain injury (TBI), macrophage polarization influences the extent of pathogenesis, and efforts are underway to eliminate pathogenic subsets. However, previous studies have not distinguished whether the simultaneous presence of both classical and alternative activation signatures represents the admixture of differentially polarized macrophages, or if they have adopted a unique state characterized by components of both classical and alternative activation. Results: We analyzed the polarization of individual macrophages responding to TBI using single-cell RNA sequencing. Analysis of signature polarization genes revealed diverse activation states, including M(IL4), M(IL10), and M(LPS, IFNγ). However, the expression of a given polarization marker was no more likely than at random to predict simultaneous expression or repression of markers of another polarization program within the same cell, suggesting a lack of exclusivity in macrophage polarization states in vivo in TBI. Also unexpectedly, individual TBI macrophages simultaneously expressed high levels of signature polarization genes across two or three different polarization states, and in several distinct and seemingly incompatible combinations. Conclusions: Single-cell gene expression profiling demonstrated that monocytic macrophages in TBI are not comprised of distinctly polarized subsets, but are uniquely and broadly activated. TBI macrophage activation in vivo is deeply complex, with individual cells concurrently adopting both inflammatory and reparative features. These data provide physiologically relevant evidence that the early macrophage response to TBI is comprised of novel activation states that are discordant with the current paradigm of macrophage polarization—a key consideration for therapeutic modulation.

Title: Whole organism lineage tracing by combinatorial and cumulative genome editing 
Summary: Multicellular systems develop from single cells through a lineage, but current lineage tracing approaches scale poorly to whole organisms. Here we use genome editing to progressively introduce and accumulate diverse mutations in a DNA barcode over multiple rounds of cell division. The barcode, an array of CRISPR/Cas9 target sites, records lineage relationships in the patterns of mutations shared between cells. In cell culture and zebrafish, we show that rates and patterns of editing are tunable, and that thousands of lineage-informative barcode alleles can be generated. By sampling hundreds of thousands of cells from individual zebrafish, we find that most cells in adult zebrafish organs derive from relatively few embryonic progenitors. Genome editing of synthetic target arrays for lineage tracing (GESTALT) will help generate large-scale maps of cell lineage in multicellular systems.

Title: Tracing the Formation of Haematopoietic Stem Cells in Mouse Embryos by Single-cell Functional and RNA-Seq Analyses [single-cell] 
Summary: Haematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are derived early from embryonic precursor cells, such as haemogenic endothelial cells and pre-HSCs. However, the identity of precursor cells remains elusive due to their rareness, transience, and inability to be isolated efficiently. Here we employed potent surface markers to capture the nascent pre-HSCs at 30% purity, as rigorously validated by single-cell-initiated serial transplantation assay. Then we applied single-cell RNA-Seq technique to analyse five populations closely related to HSC formation: endothelial cells, CD45- and CD45+ pre-HSCs in E11 aorta-gonad-mesonephros (AGM) region, and mature HSCs in E12 and E14 foetal liver. In comparison, the pre-HSCs showed unique features in transcriptional machinery, apoptosis, metabolism state, signalling pathway, transcription factor network, and lncRNA expression pattern. Among signalling pathways enriched in pre-HSCs, the mTOR activation was uncovered indispensable for the emergence of HSCs but not haematopoietic progenitors from endothelial cells in vivo. By comparing with proximal populations without HSC potential, the core molecular signature of pre-HSCs was identified. Collectively, our work paves the way for dissection of complex molecular mechanisms regulating the step-wise generation of HSCs in vivo, informing future efforts to engineer HSCs for clinical application.

Title: Single Novel single cell assay reveals progressive lymphoid defect in aging multipotent hematopoietic progenitors Cell RNA-seq reveals LMPP clonal dynamics in aging. 
Summary: Declining immune function with age is associated with reduced lymphoid output of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs). Currently, there is poor understanding of the dynamic changes with age in the heterogeneous multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell compartment, which regulates output of differentiated lymphoid cells. In this study, we observed progressive and specific loss of lymphoid-primed multipotent progenitor cells (LMPP/MPP4) as young animals began to age. Single cell RNA-seq revealed a concomitant increase in cycling of these progenitors with loss of a lymphoid priming signature. To interrogate functional multipotency of single cells, we developed a novel, feeder-free in vitro assay to concurrently assess lymphoid and myeloid potential. This assay revealed altered clonal composition of the LMPP/MPP4 compartment with aging, where progenitors with B cell and macrophage-restricted potential are lost while functionally multipotent progenitors are preserved. These results pinpoint an age and cellular compartment to focus further interrogation of the drivers of lymphoid cell loss with aging.

Title: Single-cell RNA-seq reveals distinct maturation stages of the Paneth cell lineage 
Summary: Paneth cells (PCs) are long-lived secretory cells that reside at the bottoms of small intestinal crypts. Besides serving as niche cells for the neighboring Lgr5-positive stem cells, PCs secrete granules containing a broad spectrum of antimicrobial proteins, including lysozymes and defensins1. Here, we have used single-cell RNA sequencing to explore PC differentiation. We found a maturation gradient from early secretory progenitors to mature PCs, capturing the full maturation path of PCs. Moreover, differential expression of a subset of defensin genes in lysozyme-high PCs, e.g. Defa20, reveals at least two distinct stages of maturation.

Title: Single-cell transcriptional profiling of Th17 cells, differentiated in vitro for 48h [TGFB1_IL6-48h-IL-17A/GFP+] 
Summary: Extensive cellular heterogeneity exists within specific immune-cell subtypes classified as a single lineage, but its molecular underpinnings are rarely characterized at a genomic scale. Here, we use single-cell RNA-seq to investigate the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneity and pathogenicity of Th17 cells isolated from the central nervous system (CNS) and lymph nodes (LN) at the peak of autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) or polarized in vitro under either pathogenic or non-pathogenic differentiation conditions. Computational analysis reveals a spectrum of cellular states in vivo, including a self-renewal state, Th1-like effector/memory states and a dysfunctional/senescent state. Relating these states to in vitro differentiated Th17 cells, unveils genes governing pathogenicity and disease susceptibility. Using knockout mice, we validate four novel genes: Gpr65, Plzp, Toso and Cd5l (in a companion paper). Cellular heterogeneity thus informs Th17 function in autoimmunity, and can identify targets for selective suppression of pathogenic Th17 cells while sparing non-pathogenic tissue-protective ones.

Title: Quantitative assessment of single-cell RNA sequencing methods 
Summary: We generated single-cell transcriptomes from a large number of single cells using several commercially available platforms, in both microliter and nanoliter volumes, and compared performance between them. We benchmarked each method to conventional RNA-seq of the same sample using bulk total RNA, as well as to multiplexed qPCR, which is the current gold standard for quantitative single-cell gene expression analysis. In doing so, we were able to systematically evaluate the sensitivity, precision, and accuracy of various approaches to single-cell RNA-seq. Our results show that it is possible to use single-cell RNA-seq to perform quantitative transcriptome measurements of individual cells, that it is possible to obtain quantitative and accurate gene expression measurements with a relatively small number of sequencing reads, and that when such measurements are performed on large numbers of cells, one can recapitulate the bulk transcriptome complexity, and the distributions of gene expression levels found by single-cell qPCR.

Title: RNA-Seq of cKIT+ sorted cells from 16-16.5 week old fetal testes and ovaries and RNA-Seq of TRA-1-60+ H1 hESCs 
Summary: Generation of research quality, clinically relevant cell types in vitro from human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) requires detailed understanding of the equivalent cell types in humans. Here we analyzed 130 human fetal samples at 6-20 weeks of development and identified the stages in which human cKIT+ primordial germ cells (PGCs), the precursors of gametes, undergo whole genome epigenetic reprogramming and ultimately initiation of imprint erasure with loss of both 5mC and 5-hydroxy-mC at differentially methylated regions. Using five alternate in vitro differentiation strategies combined with a single-cell microfluidic analysis, high throughput RNA sequencing and a bona fide human cKIT+ PGC signature, we show that hPSC differentiation generates a rare cKIT+ PGC subtype found in both the human fetal gonad and mouse embryo. Taken together, our study creates a resource of human germ line ontogeny that is absolutely essential for future studies aimed at interpreting in vitro differentiation of the human germ line.

Title: The Nature and Nurture of Cell Heterogeneity: Accounting for Macrophage Gene-environment Interactions with Single-cell RNA-Seq 
Summary: Background: Single-cell RNA-Seq can be a valuable and unbiased tool to dissect cellular heterogeneity, despite the transcriptome’s limitations in describing higher functional phenotypes and protein events. Perhaps the most important shortfall with transcriptomic ‘snapshots’ of cell populations is that they risk being descriptive, only cataloging heterogeneity at one point in time, and without microenvironmental context. Studying the genetic (‘nature’) and environmental (‘nurture’) modifiers of heterogeneity, and how cell population dynamics unfold over time in response to these modifiers is key when studying highly plastic cells such as macrophages. Results: We introduce the programmable PolarisTM microfluidic lab-on-chip for single-cell sequencing, which performs live-cell imaging while controlling for the culture microenvironment of each cell. Using gene-edited macrophages we demonstrate how previously unappreciated knockout effects of SAMHD1, such as an altered oxidative stress response, have a large paracrine signaling component. Furthermore, we demonstrate single-cell pathway enrichments for cell cycle arrest and APOBEC3G degradation, both associated with the oxidative stress response and altered proteostasis. Interestingly, SAMHD1 and APOBEC3 are both HIV-1 inhibitors (‘restriction factors’), with no previously known co-regulation. Conclusion: As single-cell methods continue to mature, so will the ability to move beyond simple ‘snapshots’ of cell populations towards studying the determinants of population dynamics. By combining single-cell culture, live-cell imaging, and single-cell sequencing, we have demonstrated the ability to study cell phenotypes and microenvironmental influences. It’s these microenvironmental components - ignored by standard single-cell workflows - that likely determine how macrophages, for example, react to inflammation and form treatment resistant HIV reservoirs.

Title: Tn5 transposase and tagmentation procedures for massively scaled sequencing projects 
Summary: Massively parallel DNA sequencing of thousands of samples in a single machine-run is now possible, but the preparation of the individual sequencing libraries is expensive and time-consuming. Tagmentation-based library construction, using the Tn5 transposase, is efficient for generating sequencing libraries but currently relies on undisclosed reagents, which severely limits development of novel applications and the execution of large scale projects. Here, we present simple and robust procedures for Tn5 transposase production and optimized reaction conditions for tagmentation-based sequencing library construction. We further show how molecular crowding agents both modulate library lengths and enable efficient tagmentation from sub-picogram amounts of cDNA. Comparison of single-cell RNA-sequencing libraries generated using produced and commercial Tn5 demonstrated equal performances in terms of gene detection and library characteristics. Finally, as naked Tn5 can be annealed to any oligonucleotide of choice, for example molecular barcodes in single-cell assays or methylated oligonucleotides for bisulfite sequencing, custom Tn5 production and tagmentation enables innovation in sequencing-based applications.

Title: Single Cell RNA-Sequencing Identifies Diverse Roles of Epithelial Cells in Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis 
Summary: Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a lethal interstitial lung disease causing alveolar remodeling, inflammation, and fibrosis. We utilized single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-Seq) to identify epithelial cell types and associated biological processes involved in the pathogenesis of IPF. Transcriptomic analysis of epithelial cells from normal human lung defined gene expression patterns associated with highly differentiated alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells, indicated by enrichment of RNAs critical for surfactant homeostasis. In contrast, scRNA-seq of IPF cells identified three distinct subsets of epithelial cell types with characteristics of conducting airway basal and goblet cells and, an additional atypical "transitional" cell that contribute to pathological processes in IPF. Individual IPF cells frequently co-expressed alveolar AT1, AT2, and conducting airway selective markers, demonstrating "indeterminate" states of differentiation not seen in normal lung development. Pathway analysis predicted aberrant activation of canonical signaling via TGF-ß, HIPPO/YAP, P53, and AKT-PI3 Kinase. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy identified the disruption of alveolar structure and loss of the normal proximal-peripheral differentiation of pulmonary epithelial cells. Single cell transcriptomic analyses of respiratory epithelial cells identified loss of normal epithelial cell identities and unique contributions of epithelial cells to the pathogenesis of IPF. Present scRNA-seq transcriptomic analysis of normal and IPF respiratory epithelial cells provides a rich data source to further explore lung health and disease.

Title: Deconstructing the dynamic transcriptional program of pluripotent stem cells. 
Summary: Pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) are capable of dynamic interconversion between distinct substates, but the regulatory circuits specifying these states and enabling transitions between them are not well understood. We set out to address this issue and map the landscape of gene expression variability in PSCs by single-cell expression profiling of PSCs under different chemical and genetic perturbations. We find that signaling factors and developmental regulators show highly variable expression in PSCs, with expression states for some variable genes heritable through multiple cell divisions. Expression variability and population heterogeneity can be influenced by perturbation of signaling pathways and chromatin regulators. Strikingly, either removal of mature miRNAs or pharmacologic blockage of external signaling pathways drives PSCs into a low-noise ground state characterized by a reconfigured pluripotency regulatory network, increased self-renewal efficiency, and a distinct chromatin state, an effect mediated by the action of opposing miRNA families on the c-myc / Lin28 / let-7 axis. These findings illuminate the causes of transcriptional heterogeneity in PSCs and their consequences for cellular decision-making.

Title: A distinct gene module uncouples dysfunction from activation in tumor-infiltrating T cells (batch 1) 
Summary: Reversing the dysfunctional T cell state that arises in cancer and chronic viral infections is the focus of therapeutic interventions; however, current therapies are effective in only some patients and some tumor types. To gain a deeper molecular understanding of the dysfunctional T cell state, we analyzed population and single-cell RNA profiles of CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and used genetic perturbations to identify a distinct gene module for T cell dysfunction that can be uncoupled from T cell activation. This distinct dysfunction module is downstream of intracellular metallothioneins that regulate zinc metabolism and can be identified at single-cell resolution. We further identify Gata-3, a zinc-finger transcription factor in the dysfunctional module, as a regulator of dysfunction, and use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to show that it drives a dysfunctional phenotype in CD8+ TILs. Our results open novel avenues for targeting dysfunctional T cell states, while leaving activation programs intact.

Title: ATAC-seq data 
Summary: A single hematopoietic stem cell can give rise to all blood cells with remarkable fidelity. Here, we define the chromatin accessibility and transcriptional landscape controlling this process in thirteen primary cell types that traverse the hematopoietic hierarchy. Exploiting the finding that enhancer landscapes better reflect cell identity than mRNA levels, we enable "enhancer cytometry" for accurate enumeration of pure cell types from complex populations. We further reveal the lineage ontogeny of genetic elements linked to diverse human diseases. In acute myeloid leukemia, chromatin accessibility reveals distinctive regulatory evolution in pre-leukemic HSCs (pHSCs), leukemia stem cells, and leukemic blasts. These leukemic cells demonstrate unique lineage infidelity, confirmed by single cell regulomes. We further show that pHSCs have a competitive advantage that is conferred by reduced chromatin accessibility at HOXA9 targets and is associated with adverse patient outcomes. Thus, regulome dynamics can provide diverse insights into human hematopoietic development and disease.

Title: Microfluidic single-cell whole-transcriptome sequencing 
Summary: Single-cell whole-transcriptome analysis is a powerful tool for quantifying gene expression heterogeneity in populations of cells. Many techniques have, thus, been recently developed to perform transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq) on individual cells. To probe subtle biological variation between samples with limiting amounts of RNA, more precise and sensitive methods are still required. We adapted a previously developed strategy for single-cell RNA-Seq that has shown promise for superior sensitivity and implemented the chemistry in a microfluidic platform for single-cell whole transcriptome analysis. In this approach, single cells are captured and lysed in a microfluidic device, where mRNAs with poly(A) tails are reverse-transcribed into cDNA. Double-stranded cDNA is then collected and sequenced using a next-generation sequencing platform. We prepared 94 libraries consisting of single mouse embryonic cells and technical replicates of extracted RNA and thoroughly characterized the performance of this technology. Microfluidic implementation increased mRNA detection sensitivity as well as improved measurement precision compared with tube-based protocols. With 0.2M reads per cell, we were able to reconstruct a majority of the bulk transcriptome with 10 single cells. We also quantified variation between and within different types of mouse embryonic cells and found that enhanced measurement precision, detection sensitivity, and experimental throughput aided the distinction between biological variability and technical noise. With this work, we validated the advantages of an early approach to single-cell RNA-Seq and showed that the benefits of combining microfluidic technology with high-throughput sequencing will be valuable for large-scale efforts in single-cell transcriptome analysis.

Title: Defining a molecular roadmap of cellular reprogramming into iPS cells [ChIP-Seq] 
Summary: Factor induced reprogramming is a slow and inefficient process with only rare cells progressing towards induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Owing to these restraints, mechanistic studies have been limited to analyses of heterogeneous bulk populations undergoing reprogramming and partially reprogrammed cell lines. Here, by combining surface markers (Thy1, SSEA1) and an Oct4-GFP fluorescent reporter allele, we analyzed defined intermediate cell populations poised to becoming iPSCs at the transcriptional and epigenetic levels using genome-wide and single cell technologies. We found that factor-induced reprogramming elicits two discernible transcriptional waves that are characterized by the initial extinction of the somatic gene expression program and the concomitant acquisition of an ESC-like proliferative and metabolic state, followed by the activation of an embryonic pluripotent state primed for differentiation. The first wave is mostly driven by gene activation through c-Myc and gene repression by Klf4, whereas the second wave is a result of gradually activated Oct4/Sox2 targets in cooperation with Klf4 targets and other downstream regulators. While microRNA expression and enrichment for individual histone modifications (H3K4me3 or H3K27me3 enriched promoters) mirrored the observed biphasic transcriptional pattern, the establishment of bivalent domains (H3K4me3/H3K27me3 enriched promoters) occurred more gradually. In contrast, changes in DNA methylation took place predominantly at the end of reprogramming when cells assumed a stable pluripotent state. Cells that became refractory to reprogramming activated the first but failed to initiate the second transcriptional wave. However, introduction of additional copies of the reprogramming transgenes into these cells rescued their ability to form iPSCs, indicating that suboptimal transcription factor levels are a limiting factor for efficient iPSC formation. This integrative analysis allowed us to identify novel genes and microRNAs that enhance reprogramming and surface markers that further subdivide intermediate cell populations. Collectively, our data offer new mechanistic insights into the nature and sequence of molecular events inherent to cellular reprogramming and provide a valuable resource of molecules that may act as roadblocks during iPSC formation.

Title: A multi-step transcriptional and chromatin cascade underlies motor neuron programming (single-cell RNA-seq) 
Summary: Direct programming via the overexpression of transcription factors (TFs) aims to control cell fate at a precision that will be instrumental for clinical applications. However, direct programming of terminal fates remains an obscure process. Taking advantage of the rapid and uniquely efficient programming of spinal motor neurons by overexpression of Ngn2, Isl1 and Lhx3, we have characterized gene expression, chromatin and transcription factor binding time-course dynamics during complete motor neuron programming. Our studies point to a surprisingly dynamic programming process. Promoter chromatin and expression analysis reveals at least three distinct phases of gene activation, while programming factor binding shifts from one set of targets to another, controlling regulatory region activity and gene expression. Furthermore, our evidence suggest that the enhancers and genes activated in the final stage of motor neuron processing are dependent on the combined activities of Isl1 and Lhx3 factors with Ebf and Onecut TFs that are themselves activated midway through the programming process. Our results suggest an unexpected multi-stage model of motor neuron programming in which the programming TFs require activation of a set of intermediate regulators before they complete the programming process.

Title: Identification of subset-specific dendritic cell progenitors reveals early commitment in the bone marrow [RNA-Seq] 
Summary: Dendritic cells (DCs) are antigen sensing and presenting cells that are essential for effective immunity. Existing as a multi-subset population, divided by distinct developmental and functional characteristics1,2, DC subsets play important and unique roles in responses to pathogens, vaccines and cancer therapies, as well as during immune-pathologies. Therefore therapeutic manipulation of the DC compartment is an attractive strategy. However, our incomplete knowledge of the inter-relationship between DC subsets and how they develop from progenitors in the bone marrow (BM) has so far limited the realization of their therapeutic potential. DCs arise from a cascade of progenitors that gradually differentiate in the BM; first, the macrophage DC progenitor (MDP), then common DC progenitor (CDP), and lastly the Pre-DC, which will leave the BM to seed peripheral tissues before differentiating into mature DCs3,4. While the basic outline of this process is known, how subset commitment and development is regulated at the molecular level remains poorly understood. Here we reveal that the Pre-DC population in mice is heterogeneous, containing uncommitted Ly6c+/-Siglec-H+ cells as well as Ly6c+Siglec-H- and Ly6c-Siglec-H- sub-populations that are developmentally fated to become Th2/17-inducing CD11b+ DCs and Th1-inducing CD8α+ DCs, respectively. Using single cell analysis by microfluidic RNA sequencing, we found that DC subset imprinting occurred at the mRNA level from the CDP stage, revealing that subset fate is defined in the BM and not in peripheral tissues. Single cell transcriptome analysis allowed identification of the molecular checkpoints between progenitor stages and revealed new regulators of DC-poiesis, shedding light on the role of cell cycle control and specific transcription factors in DC lineage development. These data advance our knowledge of the steady-state regulation of DC populations and open promising new avenues for investigation of the therapeutic potential of DC subset-specific targeting in vivo to improve vaccine-based and immunotherapeutic strategies.
